Everyone asks advanced React questions.

But most candidates fail at the basics.

If you’re preparing for a React interview, make sure you can clearly answer these foundational questions (without Googling):

1. Why do we need keys in React lists?
   (Not “to remove warning” — explain reconciliation.)
2. What is the difference between state and props?
   (And when should state NOT be used?)
3. Why shouldn’t we mutate state directly?
   (What actually breaks?)
4. What causes a component to re-render?
   (Be precise.)
5. useEffect: when does it run and why?
   (Dependency array is not optional knowledge.)
6. Controlled vs uncontrolled components
   (And which one do you use in real forms?)
7. What is lifting state up?
   (Why does it reduce bugs?)
8. Why does React use a virtual DOM?
   (Conceptual clarity > buzzwords.)
9. What is memoization in React?
   (When does useMemo actually help?)
10. What happens when you pass a function as a prop?
    (Referential equality matters.)

If you can explain these confidently,

you already outperform 70% of React interview candidates.

Frameworks change.
Libraries come and go.
Fundamentals compound.

If you’re interviewing soon:

Which of these questions do you struggle with the most?
