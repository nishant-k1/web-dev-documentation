Here’s what interviewers expect in 2025-2026:
1️⃣ Deep JavaScript fundamentals
Not syntax. Not definitions. Actual depth.
Things like:
event loop phases
microtasks vs macrotasks
closures and scope
prototypes
async patterns
browser internals
script loading (async, defer)
memory leaks
Web APIs
real debugging
If your fundamentals are weak, React will also feel weak this is the harsh truth.

2️⃣ Build-with-logic Machine Coding Rounds
This is where 70% of candidates fail.
Companies want to see you build:
modal
search filter
pagination
infinite scroll
custom debounce/throttle
state container
small utilities
DOM manipulations
No libraries.
No shortcuts.
Just your thinking.

3️⃣ React but with Depth
React interviews today are not about “what is useState?”
They ask:
Why is this re-render happening?
Why did this component break memoization?
When would you choose context vs Redux vs Zustand?
How would you optimize a slow component tree?
Explain hydration mismatch.
SSR vs ISR vs CSR vs streaming.
They want engineers, not just coders.

4️⃣ Next.js Knowledge Is Slowly Becoming a Default
Even if the job description says “React”, they expect:
routing basics
data fetching patterns
caching & revalidation
server vs client components
performance
loading patterns
Next.js is forcing everyone to think like a full-stack/frontend hybrid.

5️⃣ System Design (LLD + HLD)
Yes, even frontend roles now expect:
component composition
reusable architecture
design trade-offs
performance impact
accessibility
large-scale patterns
