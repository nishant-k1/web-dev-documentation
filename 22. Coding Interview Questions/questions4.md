Recently, I attended an interview with Accenture for a frontend role (React).

With 4.5+ years of experience, the discussion was heavily focused on performance, browser behavior, and real-world React decisions rather than just syntax.

These are some of the types of questions discussed 👇

🔹 React & Rendering

1. Why does React use the Virtual DOM instead of the real DOM?
2. Class vs Functional Components – performance differences
3. Stateful vs Stateless components
4. How React handles re-renders and memory

🔹 Performance Optimization

5. Rendering large tables with minimal memory usage
6. map() vs forEach() in render – why one works and the other doesn’t
7. When function declarations vs arrow functions impact performance
8. How unnecessary re-renders happen and how to avoid them

🔹 Hooks & State Management

9. Explanation of different React hooks (especially useContext)
10. How thunk-based API calls work and how caching behaves
11. Where and how to store user data securely on the client side

🔹 Browser & JavaScript Internals

12. What happens if a browser tab reaches its memory limit
13. Multi-tab logout synchronization without page refresh
14. Promise handling (Promise.all – success vs failure cases)
15. Execution order and console output–based questions
16. Deep questions on Type Coercion
