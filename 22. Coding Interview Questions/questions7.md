React.js Interview Experience | Basic API Integration (20 Q&A)
Recently attended an interview where React API integration was a major focus.
Sharing 20 basic yet important questions & answers that were asked 👇
🔹 1. What is API integration in React?
API integration means connecting a React application with a backend service using HTTP requests to fetch or send data.
🔹 2. Which library is commonly used for API calls in React?
fetch() (built-in) and Axios are the most commonly used libraries.
🔹 3. What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client used to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
🔹 4. Difference between fetch and axios?
Fetch needs manual JSON conversion, while Axios automatically converts response to JSON.
🔹 5. What is useEffect used for API calls?
useEffect() is used to perform side effects like API calls when a component loads.
🔹 6. Why should API calls not be made directly in render?
Because render should remain pure and API calls cause side effects.
🔹 7. What is dependency array in useEffect?
It controls when the effect runs (on mount, update, or unmount).
🔹 8. How do you handle loading state?
By using useState() to show loaders until data is fetched.
🔹 9. How do you handle API errors?
Using try-catch block or .catch() method.
🔹 10. What is async/await?
A cleaner way to handle promises in JavaScript.
🔹 11. How do you pass API data to components?
Using props or global state (Context / Redux).
🔹 12. What is REST API?
An API that follows REST principles using HTTP methods.
🔹 13. Difference between GET and POST?
GET fetches data, POST sends data to the server.
🔹 14. How do you send headers in API?
Using headers object (Authorization, Content-Type).
🔹 15. What is JSON?
A lightweight data-interchange format used in APIs.
🔹 16. What is CORS?
Security mechanism that controls cross-origin requests.
🔹 17. What is API response status?
HTTP codes like 200, 404, 500 indicate request result.
🔹 18. How do you cancel API calls?
Using AbortController or Axios cancel token.
🔹 19. How do you call API on button click?
By calling API function inside an event handler.
🔹 20. Best practice for API integration?
Use separate service files and proper error handling.

Strong fundamentals + clean API handling = confident React developer
If you’re preparing for React interviews, master API integration basics first
