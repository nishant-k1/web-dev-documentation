# diffing algo workes between the old vDOM and newVDOM after mutation to the oldVDOM or newVDOM and RealDOM to mutate the real DOM

Diffing never happens against the real DOM.
It always happens between two in-memory trees.

.

🔹 Important Rule

React never diffs against the real DOM.

The real DOM is only updated during commit.

Diffing happens before any real DOM mutation.

🔹 What Actually Happens (Modern Fiber Model)

```text
Build work-in-progress Fiber tree
    ↓
Compare with current Fiber tree
    ↓
Mark updates
    ↓
Commit DOM mutations
```

**Step 1 — Build Work-In-Progress Tree**

React runs your component again and builds a new tree in memory.
This is not mutating the old tree.
It creates a separate "work-in-progress" tree.

**Step 2 — Compare With Current Tree**

While building the new tree, React compares:
Element types
Keys
Props
Children structure

This is the diffing algorithm.

This process is called reconciliation.
Still no real DOM touched.

**Step 3 — Mark Updates**
If React sees a difference, it marks the Fiber node with flags like:
Placement
Update
Deletion

These flags are stored on Fiber nodes.

**Step 4 — Commit Phase**

Now React walks the marked fibers and:
Inserts DOM nodes
Updates attributes
Removes nodes

Only here does real DOM change.

🔹 Old Mental Model vs Accurate Mental Model
Old simplified explanation:
`New vDOM → diff → patch DOM`

More precise version:

Current Fiber tree (represents UI on screen)
Work-in-progress Fiber tree (represents next UI)
Diff happens between those two
DOM mutations happen after diff is complete

🔹 Key Clarification
The real DOM is never used for comparison.
React trusts its Fiber tree as the source of truth.
Real DOM is treated as a dumb output target.

## Diffing algo works between old vDOM and new vDOM after mutation?

No mutation yet.
The new tree is built separately.

Does it compare with real DOM? No. Never.

Comparison is always:
Current Fiber tree ↔ Work-in-progress Fiber tree

```text
Render Phase:
  - Build new Fiber tree
  - Compare with current Fiber tree
  - Mark differences

Commit Phase:
  - Apply differences to real DOM
```
