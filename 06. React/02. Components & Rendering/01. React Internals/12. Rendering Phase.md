# Rendering Phase

Excellent question. This is where many people mix terminology.

Short answer:

No. Updating the real DOM is NOT part of the render phase or reconciliation.  
It is part of the commit phase.

Let’s make this airtight.

---

🔹 What Is Rendering (Render Phase)?

Rendering means:

- Running component functions
- Executing hooks
- Building the work-in-progress Fiber tree
- Comparing it with the current Fiber tree
- Marking what changed

This entire process is reconciliation.

During this phase:

❌ No real DOM changes happen  
❌ Nothing visible updates  
✅ React is just calculating

So reconciliation = render phase work.

---

🔹 What Is Reconciliation?

Reconciliation is:

The process of comparing the new tree with the old tree and figuring out what changed.

It happens during render phase.

It does NOT touch the real DOM.

---

🔹 What Is Commit Phase?

Commit phase is:

Applying the changes that reconciliation already calculated.

This is where:

- DOM nodes are inserted
- DOM attributes are updated
- DOM nodes are removed
- Layout effects run
- Passive effects run later

Real DOM mutation happens here.

🔹 So The Clean Separation Is

Using your updated flow:

```text
Build work-in-progress Fiber tree
    ↓
Compare with current Fiber tree
    ↓
Mark updates
    ↓
Commit DOM mutations
```

Everything above Commit DOM mutations
= Render phase + Reconciliation

Everything below
= Commit phase

🔹 Why React Separates Them

Because:

Render phase:

- Can be paused
- Can be restarted
- Can be discarded
- Must stay pure

Commit phase:

- Cannot be paused
- Must complete
- Actually mutates the browser DOM

If DOM mutation happened during reconciliation,  
React couldn’t support concurrent rendering.

---

🔹 So Final Precise Answer

Updating the real DOM is:

❌ Not part of rendering  
❌ Not part of reconciliation  
✅ Part of commit phase

Reconciliation calculates changes.  
Commit applies changes.
