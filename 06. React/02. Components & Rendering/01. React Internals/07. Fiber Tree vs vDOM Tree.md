# Fiber Tree vs vDOM Tree

People often use these terms interchangeably.

But they are not exactly the same thing.

---

🔹 1️⃣ vDOM Tree (Conceptual Model)

The Virtual DOM (vDOM) is:

- An in-memory representation of UI
- A JavaScript object structure
- A lightweight description of what the DOM should look like

In early React (pre-Fiber), this was:

- A simple tree of plain JS objects
- Created during render
- Compared (diffed) against previous tree
- Then changes were applied to real DOM

So conceptually:

vDOM = virtual representation of UI before touching real DOM

---

🔹 2️⃣ Fiber Tree (Modern Implementation)

Fiber is the modern implementation of the virtual DOM.

Instead of plain JS objects, React now uses:

- A linked node-based structure
- Called the Fiber tree

Each Fiber node contains:

- Component type
- Props
- State
- Hooks data
- Effect flags
- Child / sibling / parent pointers
- Priority & scheduling metadata

So Fiber is:

vDOM + scheduling + effect tracking + prioritization

It’s much more powerful than the old vDOM object.

🔹 Structural Difference

Old vDOM:

- Simple nested object tree
- Rebuilt entirely during render
- Fully synchronous

Fiber:

- Linked list tree structure
- Built incrementally
- Interruptible
- Priority-aware
- Supports concurrent rendering

---

🔹 Key Architectural Difference

Old Model:
Create new vDOM → Diff → Update DOM

Fiber Model:
Build work-in-progress Fiber tree
↓
Compare with current Fiber tree
↓
Mark effect flags
↓
Commit DOM mutations

So reconciliation still exists —  
but now it happens using Fiber nodes.

---

🔹 Are They Two Separate Things?

Not really.

Fiber replaced the old vDOM implementation.

So today:

Fiber tree = modern virtual DOM

When people say “virtual DOM”, they usually mean Fiber — even if they don’t know it.

---

🔹 Clean Mental Model

vDOM = Concept  
Fiber = Implementation

Real DOM = Browser structure

React edits Fiber.  
Fiber drives DOM updates.

---

🔹 Final Precise Answer

The vDOM is the conceptual idea of an in-memory UI tree.

Fiber is the concrete data structure React uses today to implement that idea — plus scheduling, prioritization, and concurrency.
