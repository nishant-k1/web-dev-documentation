# Render Phase

Updating the real DOM is **NOT** part of the render phase. Real DOM updates happen in the **commit phase** (see **13. Commit Phase**).

## What is the render phase?

**Rendering** (render phase) means:

- Running component functions
- Executing hooks
- Building the work-in-progress Fiber tree
- Comparing it with the current Fiber tree
- Marking what changed

This entire process is **reconciliation**. During this phase:

- ❌ No real DOM changes happen
- ❌ Nothing visible updates
- ✅ React is just calculating

**Reconciliation** = the process of comparing the new tree with the old tree and figuring out what changed. It happens during the render phase and does **not** touch the real DOM.

---

## Why keep it separate from commit?

The render phase can be paused, restarted, or discarded and must stay pure. If DOM mutation happened during reconciliation, React couldn’t support concurrent rendering. So: **render phase** = pure and interruptible; **commit phase** = where changes are applied (see **13. Commit Phase**).

---

## Summary

- **Render phase** = reconciliation only; no DOM updates.
- Reconciliation calculates changes; the commit phase applies them.
