# ReactDOM

- Implements the updates in the browser’s real DOM based on the reconciliation results.
- The React DOM is the actual interface between React and the browser's DOM. It is responsible for rendering React components into the browser's real DOM.
- It updates the real DOM based on changes in the React application.
- React creates a `vDOM` when you define components.
- When `state` or `props` change, React updates the `vDOM`, computes the differences, and identifies the minimal changes required.
- React DOM takes these updates and applies them to the real DOM.
  -The React DOM is not directly involved in the reconciliation process but becomes critical afterward, as it executes the updates calculated during reconciliation by interacting with the real DOM. This separation ensures React applications are highly performant and optimized.

## ReactDOM vs vDOM

🔹 Are ReactDOM and vDOM the Same?

No. They are completely different things.

---

🔹 1️⃣ Virtual DOM (vDOM)

Virtual DOM is:

- An in-memory representation of the UI
- Managed by React (specifically the reconciler)
- Built during the render phase
- Used to calculate what should change

In modern React, this is implemented using the Fiber tree.

It lives entirely in JavaScript memory.

It does NOT directly touch the browser.

🔹 2️⃣ ReactDOM

ReactDOM is:

- A renderer
- A package that connects React to the browser DOM
- Responsible for updating the real DOM

Example:

```js
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
```

ReactDOM:

- Takes the finished Fiber tree
- Applies DOM mutations during commit phase
- Attaches event listeners
- Manages the browser container

So ReactDOM is the bridge between:

React (reconciler)
and
Browser DOM

---

🔹 How They Work Together

React (Core + Reconciler):

- Builds and reconciles the Fiber tree (virtual representation)

ReactDOM:

- Takes the result
- Applies changes to the real DOM

Browser:

- Paints the updated UI

---

🔹 Clean Mental Model

Fiber (vDOM) = Blueprint  
ReactDOM = Construction worker  
Real DOM = Building

React calculates.
ReactDOM applies.
Browser paints.

---

🔹 Final Precise Answer

Virtual DOM is the internal representation of UI.

ReactDOM is the renderer that applies changes to the real browser DOM.

They are related, but they are not the same thing.
