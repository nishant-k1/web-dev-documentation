# Value Equality (in JavaScript)

Value equality means two values are equal because their actual values match, not because they point to the same memory location.

## Primitives (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint)

→ are considered value-equal if their values are identical.

```js
5 === 5; // true  (value equal)
"hi" === "hi"; // true  (value equal)
true === true; // true  (value equal)
```

Even though these might not be the same instance in memory, their values are the same, so JS returns true.

## Objects never have value equality (only reference equality)

```js
{ a: 1 } === { a: 1 }  // false

```

Even though they “look same,” they are not value-equal in JS because objects compare by reference, not by value.

**Value equality = values are identical**
**Reference equality = two variables point to the same object in memory**
