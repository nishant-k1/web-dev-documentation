# Reference Equality (in JavaScript)

## Objects never have value equality (only reference equality)

```js
{ a: 1 } === { a: 1 }  // false

```

Even though they “look same,” they are not value-equal in JS because objects compare by reference, not by value.

**Value equality = values are identical**
**Reference equality = two variables point to the same object in memory**
