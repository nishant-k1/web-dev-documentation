# Performance Optimization

API performance optimization techniques - data prefetching, request deduplication, parallelization, avoiding over/under-fetching, and streaming responses.

## Topics

### 1. [Data Prefetching](./1.%20Data%20Prefetching.md)

Prefetching data before it's needed - link prefetching, route prefetching, and predictive prefetching.

### 2. [Request Deduplication](./2.%20Request%20Deduplication.md)

Preventing duplicate API requests - request deduplication patterns, caching, and libraries.

### 3. [Parallelization](./3.%20Parallelization.md)

Executing multiple API requests in parallel - Promise.all, batching, and performance benefits.

### 4. [Avoiding Over-fetching and Under-fetching](./4.%20Avoiding%20Over-fetching%20and%20Under-fetching.md)

Optimizing data fetching - GraphQL benefits, REST optimization, and field selection.

## Summary

**Performance Optimization:**
- Prefetch data before needed
- Deduplicate requests
- Parallelize independent requests
- Avoid over/under-fetching

**Key Takeaway:** Optimize API calls for better performance. Prefetch, deduplicate, parallelize, and fetch only needed data.
