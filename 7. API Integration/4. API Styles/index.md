# API architectures or API styles

1. **`API (Application Programming Interface):`** Refers to the set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows one software component to interact with another. It is the interface through which applications communicate with each other.

2. **`API Architecture (or API Style):`** Refers to the way APIs are structured and how they operate. Different API architectures (like REST, GraphQL, SOAP) dictate how data is exchanged, how clients interact with servers, and what protocols are used.
