# Interview-Focused API Topics

Critical API integration topics commonly asked in frontend developer interviews - error handling patterns, loading states, race conditions, retry logic, and testing.

---

## Topics

### 1. [Error Handling Patterns in React](./1.%20Error%20Handling%20Patterns%20in%20React.md)

React-specific error handling - error boundaries, error state management, user-friendly error messages, error recovery, and handling different error types.

### 2. [Loading States Management](./2.%20Loading%20States%20Management.md)

Loading state patterns in React - loading indicators, skeleton screens, optimistic updates, preventing loading flicker, and best practices.

### 3. [Race Conditions & Request Deduplication](./3.%20Race%20Conditions%20%26%20Request%20Deduplication.md)

Handling race conditions in API calls - preventing duplicate requests, AbortController patterns, request deduplication, and handling concurrent requests.

### 4. [Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff](./4.%20Retry%20Logic%20with%20Exponential%20Backoff.md)

Implementing retry logic for failed API requests - exponential backoff, retry strategies, when to retry, and handling retry failures.

### 5. [API Testing Strategies](./5.%20API%20Testing%20Strategies.md)

Testing API calls in React - mocking API responses, MSW (Mock Service Worker), testing error scenarios, testing loading states, and integration testing.

### 6. [Optimistic Updates](./6.%20Optimistic%20Updates.md)

Optimistic update patterns - updating UI immediately, rollback strategies, when to use optimistic updates, and handling failures.
