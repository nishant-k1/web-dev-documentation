# Tooling & Ecosystem

Tooling & Ecosystem
├─ Polyfills (community-driven compatibility code)
├─ Transpilation (e.g., Babel)
├─ Module bundlers & build tools
├─ Testing tools
├─ Minification & optimization
├─ Task runners & automation

Build belongs in the Tooling & Ecosystem category, often alongside:

Module bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, Parcel)

Transpilers (Babel, TypeScript)

Task runners (Gulp, Grunt)

Minifiers and optimizers

CI/CD pipelines (sometimes)

## Why not under JavaScript core?

Build tools are not part of the JavaScript language specification itself.
They belong to the developer tooling ecosystem that helps you write, transform, and package JS code (and other assets).
Build systems deal with project-level concerns, not language syntax or runtime behavior.
