# JavaScript

## Core JavaScript / ECMAScript

Core JS usually refers to ECMAScript — the language specification itself, including syntax, language features, data types, and core APIs like promises, classes, modules, etc.

Core JS = ECMAScript (the language)

1. Closures, Hoisting, and Scope
2. Event Loop and Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Promise chaining, Async/Await)
3. ES6+ Features (Destructuring, Spread/Rest operators, Template literals, Arrow functions, etc.)
4. Prototypes and Inheritance
5. Modules (Import/Export)

## Advanced JavaScript / JavaScript Runtime Environment

Advanced JS often means JavaScript Runtime Environment features — the APIs and capabilities provided by the environment where JS runs (like browsers or Node.js). This includes Web APIs (DOM, fetch, timers), event loop mechanics, error handling, web workers, and so on.

Advanced JS = Runtime environment features (Web APIs, event loop, etc.)

1. Web APIs (Fetch, LocalStorage, SessionStorage, setTimeout, DOM APIs, etc.)
2. Error Handling (Try/Catch, Custom Errors)
3. Debouncing and Throttling Techniques
4. Web Workers and Multithreading
5. Event Loop, Microtasks, and Macrotasks (Task Scheduling & Execution)
