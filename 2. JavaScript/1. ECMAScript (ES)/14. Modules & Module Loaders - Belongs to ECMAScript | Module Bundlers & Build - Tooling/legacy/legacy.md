# Modules in javascript

- Different pieces of codes are grouped together so that things are organized and we combine these different pieces together to make a large application.
- It's very similar to the idea of separtion of concern.
- Modules are highly self-contained and grouped together with their own specific functionality allowing them to be moved around, used by other places, or even removed without disrupting the whole system.
- We need a way to import code that we want to use, we don't necessarily have just one massive javascript file.
- Ideally, our code is broken up into different files with different fucntionality, or perhaps we even borrowing code that somebody else wrote and we want to use that in our program.
- So we need a way in javascript to import dependencies that is code that we want to use and export functionality often called an interface to allow others to use our code.
- The idea with modules extends beyond functions and classes that we saw in our programming paradigms.
- This idea of modularity actuallly goes beyond just javascript files to entire systems and distributed computing.
- The concept prevails throughout programming.
- Any serious language has a way to handle modules because you cannot build large applications without.
- Back in the day, we used to just have one page of javascript like I showed you. And that was easy enough because web pages in the nineties especially, were very simple javascript, nogthing to crazy, may be a form here and there. But things started getting bigger and bigger. We have really complex web applications now, we we can no longer keep everything in our head. We can no longer just have one javascript file and know how each piece of data is being touched by a function.
