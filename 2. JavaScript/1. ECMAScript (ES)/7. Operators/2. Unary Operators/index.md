# Unary operators

unary operators must come before the operand to have an effect.
JavaScript does not support postfix unary operators like []+ — that’s just invalid syntax.

| Operator     | Example    | Meaning             |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| `!`          | `!true`    | Logical NOT         |
| `typeof`     | `typeof x` | Type of x           |
| `++` / `--`  | `i++`      | Increment/decrement |
| `-` (negate) | `-x`       | Negate number       |
