# precedence

Comparison operators in JavaScript have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right (left-associative).

Compare values and return `true` or `false`.

- `==` (Equal)
- `!=` (Not Equal)
- `===` (Strict Equal)
- `!==` (Strict Not Equal)
- `>` (Greater Than)
- `<` (Less Than)
- `>=` (Greater or Equal)
- `<=` (Less or Equal)
