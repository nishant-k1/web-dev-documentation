# Dynamic vs Static Typing

## Dynamic Typing

- Dynamically-typed languages are those (like JavaScript) where the interpreter or Just in Time Compiler(JIT) assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.
- In dynamically typed language we don't explicitly declare variable with its type.
- Type gets checked during runtime or in JIT (Just in Time Compilation).
- Javascript is a dynamically typed language.
- Dynamic type allows you to be more flexible and write software faster
- We spend less time in syntax.

## Static Typing

- A statically-typed language is a language (such as Java, C, or C++) where variable types are known at compile time.
- In statically typed language we explicitly mention the type of a variable during its declaration.
- Typescript helps javascript to behave like a statically typed language. It adds types to javascript.
- Prevents bugs and help keep errors from happening.
- There are many tools to achieve static typing in javascript.
- We have 4 available Tools:

## Important Static Typing tools

- flow : FLOW IS A STATIC TYPE CHECKER FOR JAVASCRIPT by Facebook. It relies on babel. It is prebuilt in react app.
- Typescript (TS) : FLOW IS A STATIC TYPE CHECKER FOR JAVASCRIPT by Microsoft. It has its own compiler rather than relying on babel. It is a superset of javascript with added features and its own compiler as well. It is most popular tool for typing checking.

## New Static Typing Tools

- Elm: It is a language on its own but similar enough to javascript. It is similar to ReasonML

- ReasonML (RE): It is a programming language based on OCaml. It is a language on its own but similar enough to javascript. Reason, also known as ReasonML, is a syntax extension and toolchain for OCaml created by Jordan Walke, who also created React, at Facebook. Reason offers a syntax familiar to JavaScript programmers, and transpiles to OCaml.
