# Initialization

- `Initialization`: When we assign a value to a variable

  1. type gets dynamically assigned to the variable (based on the data type of value during runtime).
  2. memory gets allocated in the javascript engine for that value (stack for primitives and heap for non-primitives) and the variable points to the value stored at this memory location.
