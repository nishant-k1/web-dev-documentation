let obj = { a: 1 };
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.a = 2; // ?

// Freezing the Object:
// Object.freeze() makes the object immutable, preventing any changes to its properties.
// Object.freeze(obj); freezes the object obj. This means:
// You cannot add new properties to obj.
// You cannot delete existing properties from obj.
// You cannot change the values of existing properties in obj.
// Since obj is frozen, modifying its properties is prohibited. This results in the TypeError
