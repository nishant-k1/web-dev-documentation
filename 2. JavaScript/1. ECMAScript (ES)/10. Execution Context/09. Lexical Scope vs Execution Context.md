# Execution Context vs Lexical Environment

## Execution Context

- Created when a function starts running
- Contains:
  - Variable Environment
  - Lexical Environment
  - This Binding
- Temporary - destroyed when the function finishes executing
- Exists on the call stack

## Lexical Environment

- Structure that holds:
  - Variables declared in the function
  - References to the outer environment (scope chain)
- The **structure/blueprint** of the Lexical Environment is determined at compile time (based on where the function is written in the code)
- The **actual instantiation** of the Lexical Environment happens at runtime during the creation phase of the Execution Context
- Can persist beyond the execution context's lifetime (via closures)

## Key Differences

| Aspect       | Execution Context                            | Lexical Environment                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| When Created | At function invocation (runtime)             | Blueprint at compile time, instantiated at runtime |
| Lifespan     | Temporary (destroyed after function returns) | Can persist via closures                           |
| Storage      | Call Stack                                   | Heap (when closure is formed)                      |
| Purpose      | Manages function execution                   | Manages variable access and scope chain            |

## Important Note

The Lexical Environment's **structure** (what variables are accessible) is determined by where the function is defined in the code (lexical/static scoping). However, the actual **instance** with real values is created when the function is invoked.
