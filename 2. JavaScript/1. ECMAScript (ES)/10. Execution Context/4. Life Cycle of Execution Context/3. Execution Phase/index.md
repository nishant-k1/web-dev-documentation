# Execution Phase

The code inside the execution context is executed line by line.

Key Steps:

1. `Variable Assignment`:

   Variables are assigned their actual values.
   Functions are executed as they are invoked.

2. `Code Execution`:

   The Thread of Execution processes statements one by one in the Code/Execution Phase.
   If a function is called, a new execution context is created for it and pushed onto the call stack.
