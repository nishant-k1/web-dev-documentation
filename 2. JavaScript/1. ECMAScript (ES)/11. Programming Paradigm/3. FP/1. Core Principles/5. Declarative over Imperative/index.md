# Imperative vs Declarative

## Imperative

- Imperative code tells the machine what to do and how to do it.
- Lower level languages are more imperative
- jQuery is more imperative than React.js

## Declarative

- Declarative code tells the machine what to do and but doesn't tell how to do it.
- Higher level languages are more declarative
- Functional Programming helps us to be more declarative.
- In Functional Programming, using functions and composing functions we tell the computer what to do instead of how to do it.

```javascript
// more on imperative side
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++>){
    console.log(i);
}

// more on declarative side
[1,2,3].forEach(item => console.log(item));
```
