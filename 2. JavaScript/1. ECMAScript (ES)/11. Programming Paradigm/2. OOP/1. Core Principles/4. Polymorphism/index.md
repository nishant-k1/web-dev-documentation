# Polymorphism

- The idea behind the polymorphism is the ability to call the same method on different objects and each object responding in different way.
- OOP gets ability to process objects differently depending on their datatype or class. Now, because the javascript is a dynamically typed language, it actually limits the amount of polymorphism.

  1. method overloading: same methods act differently for different instances of a class.
  2. method overriding: Adding extra features or extra parameters to the method
