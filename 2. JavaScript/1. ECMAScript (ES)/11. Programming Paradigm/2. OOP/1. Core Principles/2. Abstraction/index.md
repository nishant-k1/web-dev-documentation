# Abstraction

- Abstraction means just hiding the complexity from the user that is creating simpler interfaces such as hey I'll take care of the class and there you go, you have a class with all the properties now all you do is instantiate a class and there you go, you have all the properties and methods of that class already in for you.
- The idea of abstraction says, hey, here are the methods and properties that you can use. Don't worry anything else, I'll do all the calculations behind the scenes.
- This reduces complexity because we can just see the methods and understand what this class can do.
- The idea of abstraction also helps when we have private variables and private methods.
