# Encapsulation

- Before OOP, we have procedural programming and unlike procedural programming where we just have functions modifying data with no real structure. OOP puts things in an object in a container and organizes things into units that model real world applications. This is encapsulation.
- We wrap code into boxes that related to one another so that these boxes can just interact with each other using the methods and properties that we make available. This makes code easier to maintain and more reusable.
- We have all these nice little class packages that we can use whenever we want.
