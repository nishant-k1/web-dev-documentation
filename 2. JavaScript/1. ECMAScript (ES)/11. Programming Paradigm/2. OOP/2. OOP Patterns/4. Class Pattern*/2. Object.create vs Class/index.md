# Object.create vs class

- both are same, class is just a syntactic sugar to achieve the prototypal inheritance.
- Modern/newer code bases with Object oriented principles uses class
- We can use Object.create() instead of class to achieve the same. Also Object.Create makes more pure form Object oriented programming.
