# Empty Statement

A semicolon `;` by itself is an empty statement that does nothing.

## Syntax

```js

```

## Examples

### Empty Loop Body

```js
// Loop with empty body
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++); // loop with empty body

// Equivalent to:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // empty
}
```

### Intentional Empty Statement

```js
// Sometimes used when you need a statement but don't want to do anything
if (condition);
else {
  // do something
}
```

### Empty Block vs Empty Statement

```js
// Empty statement
// Empty block (also valid)
{
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Empty loop bodies** - When loop logic is in the increment/decrement
2. **Placeholder** - When you need a statement syntactically but don't need logic
3. **Intentional no-op** - When you explicitly want to do nothing

## Important Notes

- Empty statements are valid but often indicate code that could be improved
- Can be confusing and should be used sparingly
- Consider using comments to make intent clear
- Empty blocks `{}` are often clearer than empty statements

## Best Practices

```js
// ❌ Unclear
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++);

// ✅ Better - add comment
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++); // Intentionally empty

// ✅ Even better - use empty block
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Intentionally empty
}
```
