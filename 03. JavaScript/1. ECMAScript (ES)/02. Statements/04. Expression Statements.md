# Expression Statements

Any expression followed by a semicolon becomes an expression statement. The expression is evaluated, but the result is discarded.

While an expression on its own might not always be a statement, an expression can become a statement when it's used as a standalone line of code. That's why we have the concept of expression statements!

## Syntax

```js
expression;
```

## Examples

```js
// Assignment expression as statement
x = 5;

// Function call expression as statement
console.log("Hello");

// Increment expression as statement
x++;

// Method call expression as statement
array.push(item);

// Property access expression as statement
obj.property;

// Arithmetic expression as statement
5 + 3; // Evaluates to 8, but value is discarded
```

## Key Points

- The expression is evaluated when the statement executes
- The result value is **discarded** (not used)
- Any expression can become a statement by adding a semicolon
- Expression statements are commonly used for their **side effects** (like function calls, assignments, increments)

## Common Use Cases

1. **Function calls** - Execute functions for their side effects
2. **Assignments** - Update variable values
3. **Increment/decrement** - Modify numeric values
4. **Method calls** - Invoke object methods
