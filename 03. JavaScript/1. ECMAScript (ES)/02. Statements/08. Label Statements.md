# Label Statements

Provide a label that can be referenced by `break` or `continue` statements.

## Syntax

```js
label: statement;
```

## Examples

### Basic Label with break

```js
outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  innerLoop: for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
      break outerLoop; // breaks out of outer loop
    }
  }
}
```

### Label with continue

```js
outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  innerLoop: for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (j === 2) {
      continue outerLoop; // continues outer loop
    }
  }
}
```

### Label with Block Statement

```js
blockLabel: {
  console.log("Start");
  if (condition) {
    break blockLabel; // exits the block
  }
  console.log("End");
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Breaking out of nested loops** - Exit multiple loop levels at once
2. **Continuing outer loops** - Skip to next iteration of outer loop
3. **Exiting labeled blocks** - Exit a block statement early

## Important Notes

- Labels can be used with `break` and `continue` statements
- Labels must be followed by a statement (loop, block, etc.)
- Label names follow the same rules as identifiers
- Labels are rarely used in modern JavaScript (often considered code smell)
- Consider refactoring nested loops instead of using labels

## Best Practices

While labels are valid JavaScript, they're often a sign that code could be refactored:

```js
// Instead of labels, consider:
// 1. Extract nested loops into functions
// 2. Use flags to control loop flow
// 3. Use array methods (forEach, some, every) instead of nested loops
```
