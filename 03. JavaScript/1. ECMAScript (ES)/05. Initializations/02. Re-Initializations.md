# Re-Initialization

Re-initialization refers to **initializing a variable again during declaration** after it has already been declared and initialized. This is different from re-declaration and re-assignment.

## Understanding Re-Initialization

Re-initialization happens when you:

1. Declare and initialize a variable
2. Then declare and initialize it again in the same scope

**Important Distinction:**

- **Re-initialization** = Declaration + Initialization again (requires re-declaration)
- **Re-assignment** = Just changing the value of an existing variable (no new declaration)

## Re-Initialization Rules

### `var` - Can Re-Initialize

`var` allows re-declaration, which means you can re-initialize:

```js
var x = 10; // First declaration + initialization
var x = 20; // ✅ Re-declaration + Re-initialization allowed
console.log(x); // 20
```

**What happens:**

- The second `var x = 20;` is both a re-declaration and re-initialization
- The previous value is overwritten

### `let` - Cannot Re-Initialize

`let` does not allow re-declaration in the same scope, so you cannot re-initialize:

```js
let x = 10; // First declaration + initialization
let x = 20; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
```

**Why it fails:**

- Re-initialization requires re-declaration
- `let` doesn't allow re-declaration in the same scope
- Therefore, re-initialization is not possible

### `const` - Cannot Re-Initialize

`const` does not allow re-declaration in the same scope, so you cannot re-initialize:

```js
const x = 10; // First declaration + initialization
const x = 20; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
```

**Why it fails:**

- Re-initialization requires re-declaration
- `const` doesn't allow re-declaration in the same scope
- Therefore, re-initialization is not possible

## Re-Initialization vs Re-Assignment

### Re-Initialization (Declaration + Initialization Again)

```js
var x = 10;
var x = 20; // Re-initialization (includes re-declaration)
```

### Re-Assignment (Just Changing Value)

```js
let x = 10;
x = 20; // Re-assignment (no new declaration)
```

## Re-Initialization in Different Scopes

### Same Scope - Re-Initialization

```js
function example() {
  var x = 10;
  var x = 20; // ✅ Re-initialization in same function scope

  let y = 10;
  let y = 20; // ❌ Error: Cannot re-declare in same scope
}
```

### Inner Scope - Shadowing (Not Re-Initialization)

When you declare and initialize in an inner scope, it **shadows** the outer variable (not re-initialization):

```js
let x = 10; // Outer scope

{
  let x = 20; // ✅ This is shadowing, not re-initialization
  console.log(x); // 20 (inner scope)
}

console.log(x); // 10 (outer scope)
```

**Key Point:** This is **shadowing**, not re-initialization, because they're in different scopes.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: `var` Re-Initialization

```js
var count = 0;
console.log(count); // 0

var count = 10; // Re-initialization
console.log(count); // 10
```

### Example 2: `let` Cannot Re-Initialize

```js
let count = 0;
console.log(count); // 0

// let count = 10; // ❌ Would cause SyntaxError
count = 10; // ✅ Use re-assignment instead
console.log(count); // 10
```

### Example 3: `const` Cannot Re-Initialize

```js
const count = 0;
console.log(count); // 0

// const count = 10; // ❌ Would cause SyntaxError
// count = 10; // ❌ Also SyntaxError: Cannot reassign const
```

## Summary

| Declaration Type | Can Re-Initialize? | Reason                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `var`            | ✅ Yes             | Allows re-declaration in same scope         |
| `let`            | ❌ No              | Does not allow re-declaration in same scope |
| `const`          | ❌ No              | Does not allow re-declaration in same scope |

## Important Notes

1. **Re-initialization requires re-declaration** - You cannot re-initialize without re-declaring
2. **Different from re-assignment** - Re-initialization includes declaration; re-assignment doesn't
3. **Scope matters** - Re-initialization in same scope vs shadowing in different scopes
4. **Use re-assignment instead** - For `let`, use re-assignment (`x = newValue`) instead of trying to re-initialize
5. **`const` is immutable** - Cannot re-initialize or re-assign
