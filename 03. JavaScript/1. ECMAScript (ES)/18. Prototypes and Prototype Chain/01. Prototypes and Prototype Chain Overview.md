# Prototypes and Prototype Chain Overview

Prototypes are the foundation of JavaScript's inheritance model. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, and understanding the prototype chain is crucial for mastering JavaScript.

---

## What is a Prototype?

A **prototype** is an object that serves as a template for other objects. When you access a property on an object, JavaScript first looks on the object itself, then follows the prototype chain.

---

## What is the Prototype Chain?

The **prototype chain** is the mechanism by which JavaScript looks up properties. If a property isn't found on an object, JavaScript looks at its prototype, then the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it reaches `null`.

---

## Key Concepts

1. **`[[Prototype]]`**: Internal property that points to the prototype
2. **`__proto__`**: Legacy accessor for `[[Prototype]]` (deprecated but still used)
3. **`Object.getPrototypeOf()`**: Modern way to get prototype
4. **`Object.setPrototypeOf()`**: Set prototype (use with caution)
5. **`Object.create()`**: Create object with specific prototype
6. **`Object.prototype`**: Root prototype (all objects inherit from it)

## How Prototype Chain Works

```javascript
const obj = {};
obj.toString(); // Works! How?

// JavaScript looks:
// 1. obj.toString? No
// 2. Object.prototype.toString? Yes! Found it.
```

## Prototype vs Class

- **Prototypes**: JavaScript's native inheritance model
- **Classes**: Syntactic sugar over prototypes (ES6)
- **Under the hood**: Classes use prototypes
