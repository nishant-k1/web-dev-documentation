# Dynamic Files

- Dynamic files are generated on each http request
- Dynamic files are generated on-the-fly, typically based on user inputs, preferences, or other runtime data.
- These files are usually created or altered by server-side logic before being sent to the client.
- Examples of Dynamic files:
  1. Server-rendered HTML (e.g., using PHP, Python, or Node.js)
  2. API responses (e.g., JSON or XML generated dynamically)
  3. User-specific dashboards
  4. Pages with database-driven content

server-rendered HTML can be static or dynamic depending on how it's implemented:

Static (SSG): Generated once, behaves like a static file.
Dynamic (SSR): Generated per request, behaves like dynamic content.

If your server-rendered HTML doesn't change with every request (e.g., SSG with preloaded data), then you're right: it behaves like a static file. You can even serve it via CDNs for lightning-fast delivery!
