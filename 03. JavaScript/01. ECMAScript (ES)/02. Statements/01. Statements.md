# Statement in JavaScript

A **statement** is a complete instruction for the JavaScript engine to perform an action. It is the smallest standalone unit of execution. Unlike expressions, statements do not produce a value.

## Key Characteristics

- **Performs an action** - Tells JavaScript to do something
- **Does not produce a value** - Statements don't return values (unlike expressions)
- **Standalone unit** - Can be executed independently
- **Terminated by semicolon** - Usually ends with `;` (though automatic semicolon insertion can handle this)

## Examples

```js
let x = 10; // declaration statement
x = x + 5; // assignment statement
console.log(x); // expression statement
if (x > 10) {
  // control flow statement
  console.log("Big");
}
```

## Types of JavaScript Statements

1. Block Statements
2. Declaration Statements
3. Expression Statements
4. Control Flow Statements
5. Jump Statements
6. Exception Handling Statements
7. Label Statements
8. Empty Statement
9. Debugger Statement
10. Import/Export Statements
11. With Statement

## Important Notes

1. **Semicolons**: Statements are typically terminated with semicolons, though JavaScript has Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)
2. **Expression Statements**: Any expression can become a statement by adding a semicolon
3. **Block Scope**: Block statements `{}` create new scope for `let`, `const`, and `class`
4. **Control Flow**: Statements control program flow, while expressions produce values
