# Statements vs Expressions in JavaScript

## ✅ What is an Expression?

An **expression produces a value** and can appear anywhere a value is expected.

### Examples

```js
3 + 4;
"x" + "y";
true ? "yes" : "no";
myFunction();
```

Each of these returns something.

## ✅ What is a Statement?

A **statement performs an action**.  
It tells JavaScript to _do_ something.

### Examples

```js
let x = 10;        // declaration statement
if (x > 5) {}      // control flow statement
return x;          // jump statement
for (...) {}       // loop statement
```

A statement does **not** produce a value.

---

## ✅ Expressions That Act As Statements

Some expressions can also be used as statements.  
For example:

```js
x = 5;
```

This is an **assignment expression**, but when written alone with a semicolon, it becomes an **expression statement**.

```js
console.log((x = 5)); // prints 5 because it is still an expression
```

## ✅ Easy Rule

- **Produces a value → Expression**
- **Performs an action → Statement**

## ✅ Quick Comparison Table

| Code                | Is it an Expression? | Is it a Statement?            |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `3 + 5`             | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                         |
| `let x = 10;`       | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                        |
| `x = 10;`           | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes (expression statement) |
| `if (true) {}`      | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                        |
| `function test(){}` | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                        |

## Statements vs Expressions

| Aspect             | Statement                               | Expression                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Purpose**        | Performs an action                      | Produces a value          |
| **Returns value**  | No (or completion value not accessible) | Yes                       |
| **Can be used as** | Standalone instruction                  | Part of larger expression |
| **Examples**       | `if (x) {}`, `let x = 5;`               | `x + 5`, `myFunction()`   |
