# Assignments

Assignment is the process of giving a variable a value. Unlike initialization (which is the first assignment), assignment can happen at any time after a variable is declared.

## Key Concepts

- **Assignment** = Giving a variable a value using the `=` operator
- **Initialization** = The first assignment (during or right after declaration)
- **Re-assignment** = Changing the value of an already initialized variable

## Basic Assignment

### Simple Assignment

```js
let x; // Declaration
x = 10; // Assignment
x = 20; // Re-assignment
```

### Declaration with Assignment (Initialization)

```js
let x = 10; // Declaration + Initialization (first assignment)
x = 20; // Re-assignment
```

## Assignment Operators

JavaScript provides various assignment operators:

### Simple Assignment (`=`)

```js
let x = 10;
x = 20; // Simple assignment
```

### Addition Assignment (`+=`)

```js
let x = 10;
x += 5; // Equivalent to: x = x + 5
console.log(x); // 15
```

### Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)

```js
let x = 10;
x -= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x - 3
console.log(x); // 7
```

### Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)

```js
let x = 10;
x *= 2; // Equivalent to: x = x * 2
console.log(x); // 20
```

### Division Assignment (`/=`)

```js
let x = 10;
x /= 2; // Equivalent to: x = x / 2
console.log(x); // 5
```

### Modulus Assignment (`%=`)

```js
let x = 10;
x %= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x % 3
console.log(x); // 1
```

### Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)

```js
let x = 2;
x **= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x ** 3
console.log(x); // 8
```

### Bitwise Assignment Operators

```js
let x = 5;
x &= 3; // AND assignment: x = x & 3
x |= 3; // OR assignment: x = x | 3
x ^= 3; // XOR assignment: x = x ^ 3
x <<= 1; // Left shift assignment: x = x << 1
x >>= 1; // Right shift assignment: x = x >> 1
x >>>= 1; // Unsigned right shift assignment: x = x >>> 1
```

## Assignment Behavior by Declaration Type

### `var` - Can Be Re-Assigned

```js
var x = 10;
x = 20; // ✅ Re-assignment allowed
x = "hello"; // ✅ Can change type
x = null; // ✅ Can assign any value
```

### `let` - Can Be Re-Assigned

```js
let x = 10;
x = 20; // ✅ Re-assignment allowed
x = "hello"; // ✅ Can change type
x = null; // ✅ Can assign any value
```

### `const` - Cannot Be Re-Assigned

```js
const x = 10;
x = 20; // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

**Important:** `const` prevents reassignment of the **binding**, but if the value is an object or array, you can still modify its properties/elements:

```js
const obj = { name: "John" };
obj.name = "Jane"; // ✅ Allowed - modifying property
obj = {}; // ❌ Error - cannot reassign binding

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // ✅ Allowed - modifying array
arr = []; // ❌ Error - cannot reassign binding
```

## Assignment Expressions

Assignment is an expression that returns the assigned value:

```js
let x;
let y = (x = 10); // Assignment returns the value
console.log(x, y); // 10, 10
```

This allows chaining assignments:

```js
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 10; // All variables get value 10
console.log(a, b, c); // 10, 10, 10
```

## Destructuring Assignment

You can assign values using destructuring:

### Array Destructuring

```js
let a, b, c;
[a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a, b, c); // 1, 2, 3
```

### Object Destructuring

```js
let name, age;
({ name, age } = { name: "John", age: 30 });
console.log(name, age); // "John", 30
```

## Assignment vs Initialization

### Initialization (First Assignment)

```js
let x = 10; // Initialization - first assignment during declaration
```

### Assignment (Subsequent Assignments)

```js
let x = 10; // Initialization
x = 20; // Assignment (re-assignment)
x = 30; // Assignment (re-assignment)
```

## Multiple Assignments

You can assign to multiple variables:

```js
let x = 10,
  y = 20,
  z = 30; // Multiple declarations with initialization
x = y = z = 100; // Multiple assignments
console.log(x, y, z); // 100, 100, 100
```

## Assignment Timing

Assignment happens during the **Execution Phase**:

```js
// Creation Phase: x is hoisted (var gets undefined, let/const in TDZ)
// Execution Phase:
let x; // Declaration line reached
x = 10; // Assignment happens here
console.log(x); // 10
```

## Assignment with Operators

Assignment operators combine operation and assignment:

```js
let x = 10;

x += 5; // x = x + 5 → 15
x -= 3; // x = x - 3 → 12
x *= 2; // x = x * 2 → 24
x /= 4; // x = x / 4 → 6
x %= 4; // x = x % 4 → 2
```

## Important Notes

1. **Assignment is an expression** - It returns the assigned value
2. **`const` prevents reassignment** - But allows mutation of object/array contents
3. **Assignment operators** - Shorthand for operation + assignment
4. **Timing** - Assignment happens during execution, not during hoisting
5. **Type flexibility** - `var` and `let` can be reassigned to different types

| Declaration Type | Can Re-Assign? | Notes                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `let`            | ✅ Yes         | Can reassign to any value/type                                |
| `const`          | ❌ No          | Cannot reassign binding, but can mutate object/array contents |
