# Primitive Types

- primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data.
- They represent single, immutable values and are not objects.
- Primitive values are stored directly in memory and are passed by value.

## All primitive Data Types

1. **String**: Represents a sequence of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').
2. **Number**:
   Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14).
   Special values: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN.
3. **Boolean**: Represents true or false.
4. **Undefined**:
   A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   Represents an uninitialized variable or missing value.
5. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
6. **Symbol**:
   Represents a unique identifier
   often used as object property keys.
7. **BigInt**:
   Represents integers with arbitrary precision (e.g., 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n).
   Represents integers larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.

## Characteristics of Primitive Data Types

1. `Immutability`: Primitive values cannot be changed. Any operation creates a new value.
2. `Storage`
   - Stored by Value:
   - Primitives are stored in stack.
   - Primitive values are stored directly in memory.

3. `Equality/Comparing`:
   - Primitives are `Compared by Value`, not by reference.
   - Primitives are compared based on their actual value, not by reference.
   - Two primitives with the same value are always equal, regardless of where they are stored.

   ```Javascript
    console.log(5 === 5); // true
    console.log("hello" === "hello"); // true
   ```

4. `Copying`:
   - Copying a primitive creates a completely new value. Changes to one variable do not affect others.
   - Copying a primitive value creates a new, independent copy.

   ```Javascript
    let x = 100;
    let y = x; // y gets a copy of x
    y = 200;
    console.log(x); // Output: 100 (x remains unaffected)
   ```

5. `Fixed in Size`
   - Primitives have a fixed size in memory and do not grow or shrink dynamically.
   - A number or boolean value always takes up the same amount of memory, regardless of its value.

6. `Automatically Boxed`:
   - Primitives like strings, numbers, and booleans can be treated as objects temporarily, allowing access to methods and properties.
   - This happens via autoboxing (JavaScript internally wraps the value with an object wrapper).

7. `Cannot Have Properties or Methods (Directly)`
   Primitives themselves cannot have properties or methods. Autoboxing enables the temporary use of object-like methods.

8. `Type Check with typeof`: Primitive types can be identified using the typeof operator.
