# Reference Copy

Reference copy is the default behavior when assigning one object/array to another variable. Only the reference (memory address) is copied, not the actual value.

## How Reference Copy Works

- Only reference gets copied, not the actual value.
- The default behavior when assigning one object to another.
- Both variables point to the same memory reference, so changes in one affect the other.

## Example

```js
let obj1 = { a: 1 };
let obj2 = obj1; // Reference copy
obj2.a = 2;
console.log(obj1.a); // 2 (both point to the same object)
```

## Characteristics

1. **Same memory location** - Both variables point to the same object in memory
2. **Changes are shared** - Modifying one variable affects the other
3. **Default behavior** - This happens automatically with assignment operator

## Use Cases

- **Sharing state** - When you want multiple variables to point to the same object
- **Passing references** - When passing objects to functions (by reference)
- **Aliasing** - Creating an alias for an existing object

## Important Notes

- **Not a true copy** - The object itself is not duplicated
- **Memory efficient** - No new object is created
- **Shared mutations** - Changes to one variable affect all references
- **Reference equality** - `obj1 === obj2` will be `true` after reference copy

## Example with Arrays

```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1; // Reference copy
arr2.push(4);
console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (both point to same array)
console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## When to Use

- When you want to share the same object between multiple variables
- When you want to pass an object reference to a function
- When you want to create an alias for an existing object
