# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into units called **objects**, making complex code more organized and maintainable.

## Principles of Good Code

OOP helps achieve code that is:

1. **Clear + Understandable**
2. **Easy to Extend**
3. **Easy to Maintain**
4. **Memory Efficient**
5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

## What is OOP?

- Organizes code into units called **objects**.
- An object is a container for related data and operations.
- The data is known as **attributes** or **state**, and the operations are called **methods**.
- `Objects are first-class citizens in OOP`.
- OOP is based on 4 pillars:
  1. Encapsulation
  2. Abstraction
  3. Inheritance
  4. Polymorphism
- **Few operations on common data**.
- **Stateful** — objects hold state that can be changed.
- Encourages **imperative programming**: describes **what to do and how to do it**.
- Best when you have **many entities (e.g., characters in a game)** with shared behaviors.
- Brings **data and behavior together** in one place.

## OOP in JavaScript

JavaScript is a multiparadigm language that supports OOP through:

- **Classes** (ES6+)
- **Prototypes** (traditional JavaScript)
- **Constructor Functions**
- **Factory Functions**
- **Object Literals**

## When to Use OOP

OOP is ideal when:

- You need to model **real-world entities** with shared behaviors
- You have **many objects** that share common characteristics
- You need **state management** for complex objects
- You want to **encapsulate** related data and behavior
- You need **inheritance** to avoid code duplication
