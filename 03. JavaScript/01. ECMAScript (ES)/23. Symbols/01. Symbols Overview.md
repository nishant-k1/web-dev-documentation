# Symbols Overview

Symbols are a unique primitive data type introduced in ES6 that provide a way to create unique, immutable identifiers.

## Key Characteristics

- **Unique**: Each Symbol is guaranteed to be unique, even if created with the same description
- **Immutable**: Symbols cannot be changed once created
- **Non-enumerable**: Symbols don't appear in standard iteration (for...in, Object.keys())
- **Primitive Type**: Symbols are primitives, not objects

## Basic Usage

```javascript
const sym1 = Symbol();
const sym2 = Symbol("description");
const sym3 = Symbol("description");

console.log(sym2 === sym3); // false - each Symbol is unique
```

## Common Use Cases

- Creating unique object property keys
- Defining well-known symbols (Symbol.iterator, Symbol.toStringTag, etc.)
- Preventing property name collisions in objects
- Implementing meta-programming patterns
