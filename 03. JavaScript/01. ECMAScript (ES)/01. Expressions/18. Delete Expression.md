# Delete Expression

Deletes object properties.

## Syntax

```js
delete object.property;
delete object["property"];
```

## Examples

```js
let obj = { x: 1, y: 2 };
delete obj.x; // true (removes property x)
delete obj.z; // true (property didn't exist)
```

## Return Value

```js
let obj = { x: 1 };
delete obj.x; // true (successful deletion)
delete obj.x; // true (property doesn't exist, but still returns true)
```

## Important Notes

- **Return value**: Returns `true` if deletion was successful or property didn't exist
- **Cannot delete**: Cannot delete variables, function declarations, or non-configurable properties
- **Side effect**: Modifies the object (side effect)
- **Best practice**: Use object destructuring or `Object.assign()` for immutable operations
