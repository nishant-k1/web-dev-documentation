# Handling Async Js - Belongs to ECMAScript

Async JS concepts like the event loop, task queues, microtasks, and how asynchronous callbacks are managed belong to the runtime environment (e.g., browser or Node.js).

The language features to work with async code, such as Promises, async/await syntax, and Promise methods (then, catch, finally) are part of ECMAScript itself.

| Concept                         | ECMAScript (Core JS)          | Runtime Environment (Advanced JS) |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Promises, async/await syntax    | ✅ Language feature           | ❌ Not part of runtime            |
| Event loop, microtask queue     | ❌ Not part of language       | ✅ Runtime mechanism              |
| setTimeout, fetch, DOM events   | ❌ Not part of language       | ✅ Provided by runtime (Web APIs) |
| Promise resolution and chaining | ✅ Language (ECMAScript spec) | ❌ Runtime just runs these        |
