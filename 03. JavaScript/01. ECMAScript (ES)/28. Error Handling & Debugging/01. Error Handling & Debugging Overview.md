# Error Handling & Debugging Overview

Errors (also called exceptions) are a fundamental part of programming. Understanding how to handle and debug them is crucial for building robust applications.

## What are Errors?

- **Errors aren't mistakes** - they're a feature of the language designed to help you handle unexpected situations
- **Error handling** is the process of catching and managing errors gracefully
- **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing bugs in your code

## Why Error Handling Matters

- **Prevents crashes**: Unhandled errors can crash your application
- **Better user experience**: Graceful error handling provides better feedback
- **Easier debugging**: Proper error handling makes it easier to identify and fix issues
- **Production readiness**: Real applications need robust error handling

## Key Concepts

1. **Error Types** - Different types of errors (TypeError, ReferenceError, etc.)
2. **Try-Catch Blocks** - Catching and handling errors
3. **Async Error Handling** - Handling errors in asynchronous code
4. **Custom Errors** - Creating your own error types
5. **Debugging Tools** - Tools and techniques for finding bugs
6. **Best Practices** - Patterns and strategies for error handling
