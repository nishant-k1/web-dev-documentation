# Object-Oriented Programming Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into units called **objects**, combining data and behavior together.

---

## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm where:

- **Objects are first-class citizens** - Code is organized into objects
- **Data and behavior are combined** - Objects contain both state (data) and methods (behavior)
- **Stateful** - Objects hold state that can be changed
- **Imperative** - Describes what to do and how to do it
- **Few operations on common data** - Multiple methods operate on the same object's data

## Quick Example

### Without OOP (Procedural)

```javascript
// Data and functions are separate
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25
};

function updateAge(user, newAge) {
  user.age = newAge;
}

updateAge(user, 26);
```

### With OOP (Encapsulated)

```javascript
// Data and behavior together
class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  updateAge(newAge) {
    this.age = newAge;
  }
}

const user = new User("John", 25);
user.updateAge(26);
```

**Key Difference:** OOP brings data and behavior together in one place (the object).

## Core Concepts

OOP is built on these core concepts:

- **Encapsulation** - Bundling data and methods together, hiding internal details
- **Abstraction** - Hiding complexity, showing only essential features
- **Inheritance** - Creating new classes based on existing ones
- **Polymorphism** - Same interface, different implementations

> 📖 **For detailed breakdown:** See individual concept files below

## OOP in JavaScript

JavaScript supports OOP through:

- **Classes** (ES6+) - Modern class syntax
- **Prototypes** - Traditional JavaScript inheritance
- **Constructor Functions** - Creating objects with functions
- **Factory Functions** - Functions that return objects
- **Object Literals** - Simple object creation
