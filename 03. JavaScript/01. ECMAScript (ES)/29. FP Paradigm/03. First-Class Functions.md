# FP Core Principles: First-Class Functions

In JavaScript, functions are **first-class citizens**, which means they can be treated like any other value.

---

## What are First-Class Functions?

Functions are first-class citizens when they can be:

- **Assigned to variables**
- **Passed as arguments** to other functions
- **Returned from other functions**
- **Stored in data structures** (arrays, objects)

---

## Examples

### 1. Assigned to Variables

```js
const greet = function (name) {
  return `Hello ${name}`;
};

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### 2. Passed as Arguments

```js
function execute(fn) {
  return fn();
}

function sayHello() {
  return "Hello!";
}

execute(sayHello); // "Hello!"
```

### 3. Returned from Functions

```js
function createGreeter() {
  return function (name) {
    return `Hello ${name}`;
  };
}

const greeter = createGreeter();
greeter("John"); // "Hello John"
```

### 4. Stored in Data Structures

```js
// In arrays
const operations = [
  (x) => x + 1,
  (x) => x * 2,
  (x) => x - 3,
];

// In objects
const calculator = {
  add: (a, b) => a + b,
  subtract: (a, b) => a - b,
  multiply: (a, b) => a * b,
};
```

## Why First-Class Functions Matter

First-class functions enable:

- **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions that take or return other functions
- **Function Composition** - Combining functions to build complex operations
- **Callbacks** - Passing functions as arguments for later execution
- **Closures** - Functions that capture their lexical environment

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Function Factory

```js
function createMultiplier(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);

double(5); // 10
triple(5); // 15
```

### Example 2: Array of Functions

```js
const validators = [
  (value) => value.length > 0,
  (value) => /^[a-zA-Z]+$/.test(value),
  (value) => value.length <= 20,
];

function validate(value) {
  return validators.every((validator) => validator(value));
}

validate("hello"); // true
validate(""); // false
```

---

## Closures

First-class functions work closely with closures. A closure allows a function to access variables from its outer (lexical) scope even after the outer function has returned.

> 📖 **For detailed information on closures:** See [16. Execution Context, Hoisting, Scope and Closures/12. 4. Closures.md](../15.%20Execution%20Context,%20Hoisting,%20Scope%20and%20Closures/12.%204.%20Closures.md)

## Interview Points

- First-class functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript
- They enable functional programming patterns
- Functions can be assigned, passed, returned, and stored
- First-class functions are the foundation for HOFs, callbacks, and composition
- JavaScript treats functions as values, not just executable code
