# Functional Programming Overview

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

## What is Functional Programming?

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where:

- **Functions are first-class citizens** - They can be assigned, passed, and returned like any other value
- **Pure functions** are preferred - Same input always produces same output with no side effects
- **Data is immutable** - Once created, data structures are not modified
- **Functions are composed** - Complex operations are built by combining simple functions
- **Side effects are isolated** - External interactions are minimized and controlled

## Quick Example

### Imperative Approach (Mutation)

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Kim",
  cart: [],
};

user.cart.push("item1"); // Mutates the original object
```

### Functional Approach (Immutability)

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (user, item) => ({
  ...user,
  cart: [...user.cart, item], // Creates new object
});

const user = { name: "Kim", cart: [] };
const updatedUser = addItemToCart(user, "item1");
// Original user object is unchanged
```

**Key Difference:** Functional approach creates new data instead of mutating existing data.

## Core Concepts

Functional Programming is built on these core concepts:

- **First-Class Functions** - Functions treated as values
- **Pure Functions** - No side effects, deterministic
- **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions that take/return functions
- **Closures** - Functions that capture outer scope
- **Immutability** - Data cannot be changed after creation
- **Function Composition** - Combining functions
- **Currying** - Transforming multi-arg functions
- **Recursion** - Functions calling themselves
