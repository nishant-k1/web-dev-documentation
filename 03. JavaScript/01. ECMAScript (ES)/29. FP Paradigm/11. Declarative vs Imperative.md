# FP Core Principles: Declarative vs Imperative

## Imperative

- Imperative code tells the machine **what to do and how to do it**.
- Lower level languages are more imperative
- jQuery is more imperative than React.js

---

## Declarative

- Declarative code tells the machine **what to do but doesn't tell how to do it**.
- Higher level languages are more declarative
- Functional Programming helps us to be more declarative.
- In Functional Programming, using functions and composing functions we tell the computer what to do instead of how to do it.

## Examples

### Imperative Approach

```javascript
// more on imperative side
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### Declarative Approach

```javascript
// more on declarative side
[1, 2, 3].forEach((item) => console.log(item));
```

---

## More Examples

### Imperative: Double Array Values

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  doubled.push(numbers[i] * 2);
}
```

### Declarative: Double Array Values

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
```

---

### Imperative: Filter Active Users

```js
const users = [
  { name: "John", active: true },
  { name: "Jane", active: false },
  { name: "Bob", active: true },
];

const activeUsers = [];
for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
  if (users[i].active) {
    activeUsers.push(users[i]);
  }
}
```

### Declarative: Filter Active Users

```js
const activeUsers = users.filter((user) => user.active);
```

---

### Imperative: DOM Manipulation

```js
const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "Click me";
button.className = "btn";
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
document.body.appendChild(button);
```

### Declarative: React Component

```jsx
<button className="btn" onClick={handleClick}>
  Click me
</button>
```

---

## Benefits of Declarative Code

1. **Readability**: Code expresses intent, not implementation
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
3. **Abstraction**: Hides low-level details
4. **Less Error-Prone**: Fewer opportunities for bugs
5. **Functional Style**: Aligns with FP principles

## When to Use Each

### Use Imperative When:

- Performance is critical
- Direct control is needed
- Low-level operations
- Legacy code maintenance

### Use Declarative When:

- Code clarity is priority
- Working with data transformations
- Building user interfaces
- Functional programming style

---

## Interview Points

- Imperative focuses on "how", declarative focuses on "what"
- Functional programming encourages declarative style
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) are declarative
- React's JSX is declarative UI
- Declarative code is often more readable and maintainable
