## How HTML Elements Load: Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Every browser follows a strict loading timeline when parsing HTML.
We will divide elements into 3 categories:

    1. Synchronous / Blocking
    2. Asynchronous / Non-blocking
    3. Hybrid (sometimes blocking, sometimes async)

**1. Synchronous (Blocking) Elements**
These elements stop HTML parsing until they finish loading or processing.
✔ <script> (Without async or defer)

    ```jsx
    <script src="main.js"></script>
    ```

    This is the biggest blocking element in HTML.
    Behavior:

    HTML parsing pauses
    Browser downloads the JS
    Executes it immediately
    Continues parsing HTML only after JS is done

    📌 Why does browser stop?
    Because JS can modify the DOM (document.write, etc.), so browser must wait.

**2. Asynchronous (Non-blocking) Elements**

These elements load in the background while HTML continues parsing.

✔ <img src="...">
✔ <video>
✔ <audio>
✔ <iframe> (content loads async, but insertion is synchronous)
✔ <link rel="stylesheet"> (kinda async — see below)
✔ <link rel="preload">
✔ <source>
✔ <track>

Behavior:

Browser fetches these files in parallel
HTML parsing NEVER stops because of them
They appear when loaded

```js
<img src="hero.jpg" />
<p>This text is NOT blocked by the image loading.</p>
```

**3. Hybrid Elements (Sometimes blocking, sometimes async)**

⭐ 3.1 <link rel="stylesheet"> → Asynchronous Download, Blocking Render

This is tricky.

✔ HTML parsing continues (async)
✔ CSS file downloads async in parallel
❌ BUT rendering is blocked until CSS is loaded

Meaning:

Browser continues parsing HTML

But will NOT paint the page until CSS is downloaded & applied

Why?
→ It avoids "unstyled flash" of content.

⭐ 3.2 <script> (with attributes)
✔ <script defer>

Fully asynchronous.

<script defer src="main.js"></script>

✔ Doesn't block HTML
✔ Executes after HTML is fully parsed
✔ Execution order preserved

<script async src="ads.js"></script>

✔ Doesn't block HTML
❌ Executes as soon as it finishes downloading (order NOT guaranteed)

Used for:
Ads
Analytics
Third-party widgets

✔ <script type="module">
Works like defer implicitly.

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>

✔ Async (HTML doesn't block)
✔ Runs after HTML parsing
✔ Can import other modules in parallel
✔ Execution order is NOT guaranteed unless using import dependencies

Visual Timeline Example

```html
<p>Start</p>

<script src="block.js"></script>
<!-- Blocks -->

<img src="pic.jpg" />
<!-- Async -->
<script defer src="ui.js"></script>
<!-- Async -->
<script async src="ads.js"></script>
<!-- Async -->

<p>End</p>
```

Timeline:

```txt
Parse <p>Start></p>
↓
STOP (script. browser must download then execute)
↓
Continue parsing HTML
↓
<img> loads async
↓
<script defer> loads async (executes later)
↓
<script async> loads async (executes whenever)
↓
Parse <p>End</p>
↓
Execute defer scripts
↓
Page fully rendered
```
