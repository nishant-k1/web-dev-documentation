# Mutation Overview

Mutation is the process of changing the contents or internal state of an object or array without changing its reference.

## Key Concepts

**Mutation:**

- Changing the contents of the value itself (usually for objects or arrays) without changing the reference
- Mutation changes the internals of the object the variable refers to, not the reference itself
- Refers to changing the contents or state of an existing object or array without changing the reference to that object or array

**Applies To:**

- ✅ Reference Data Types: `Arrays`, `Objects`, `Functions`, `Date`, `RegExp`
- ❌ Primitive Data Types: `Strings`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `BigInt`, `Symbol` (primitives are immutable)

## Characteristics

1. **Only objects and arrays are mutable** - Their internal properties or elements can be changed
2. **`var`, `let` and `const` all offer mutation** - `const` prevents re-assignment but allows mutation
3. **Reference stays the same** - The variable still points to the same memory location
4. **Shared references are affected** - If multiple variables reference the same object, mutation affects all

## Basic Example

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3];
a.push(4); // mutation: The variable a still points to the same array, but that array's contents have changed.
console.log(a); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
