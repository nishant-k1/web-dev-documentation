# 📚 Recommended Study Order for Built-in Objects

This document provides the recommended order to study built-in JavaScript objects based on interview importance and real-world web development needs.

---

## 🎯 Study Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Study First)

**Essential objects you'll use every day:**

1. **Object** - Base of all objects
2. **Array** - Most common data structure
3. **String** - Text manipulation
4. **Function** - Functions are objects too
5. **Number** - Number operations and utilities
6. **Boolean** - True/false values

**Why first:** These are fundamental building blocks. You cannot write JavaScript without understanding these.

---

### Phase 2: Common Utilities ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Study Early)

7. **Date** - Date and time handling
8. **Math** - Mathematical operations
9. **JSON** - Data serialization (APIs, localStorage)
10. **RegExp** - Pattern matching (validation, parsing)
11. **Error** - Error handling and debugging

**Why early:** Used frequently in real applications. Date and JSON are especially common in web development.

---

### Phase 3: Collections ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Study Early)

12. **Set** - Unique value collections
13. **Map** - Key-value pairs (better than objects in many cases)
14. **WeakSet** - Weak references for objects
15. **WeakMap** - Private data, metadata storage

**Why early:** Modern collections that solve common problems. Set and Map are frequently asked in interviews.

---

### Phase 4: Async ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical!)

16. **Promise** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - **MOST IMPORTANT FOR INTERVIEWS!**

    - Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.allSettled, Promise.any
    - Most frequently asked topic

17. **Generator** - Async generators, iteration patterns

**Why critical:** Async operations are fundamental to JavaScript. Promise is the #1 interview topic.

---

### Phase 5: Binary Data ⭐⭐⭐ (When Needed)

18. **Typed Arrays** - Performance-critical numeric operations
19. **ArrayBuffer** - Raw binary data
20. **DataView** - Flexible binary data access
21. **BigInt** - Large integers

**Why when needed:** Important for WebGL, Canvas, file handling, but not needed for basic web development.

---

### Phase 6: Advanced Features ⭐⭐⭐ (Study Later)

22. **Symbol** - Unique identifiers, meta-programming
23. **Proxy** - Metaprogramming, reactivity (React, Vue)
24. **Reflect** - Works with Proxy, object operations
25. **WeakRef** - Weak references (ES2021)
26. **FinalizationRegistry** - Cleanup callbacks (ES2021)

**Why later:** Advanced features. Proxy/Reflect important for understanding modern frameworks.

---

### Phase 7: Specialized ⭐⭐ (As Needed)

27. **Intl** - Internationalization (i18n)

- Study when building multi-language applications

28. **Iterator/AsyncIterator** - Advanced iteration protocols

- Covered in Iterators and Iterables folder

## 📊 Priority Matrix

| Priority       | Objects                                    | Study When       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 🔴 Critical    | Promise, Object, Array, String             | **Immediately**  |
| 🟠 High        | Set, Map, Date, JSON, Error                | **Early**        |
| 🟡 Medium      | Function, Number, Boolean, RegExp, Math    | **Early-Medium** |
| 🟢 Medium-Low  | Generator, Symbol, Proxy, Reflect          | **Later**        |
| 🔵 Low         | Typed Arrays, ArrayBuffer, BigInt, WeakRef | **When needed**  |
| ⚪ Specialized | Intl, Iterator                             | **As needed**    |

## 🎓 Interview Focus

**Most Frequently Asked:**

1. **Promise** - Promise.all vs Promise.race, async/await
2. **Array** - Methods, immutability, ES2023 methods
3. **Object** - Methods, freeze/seal, getters/setters
4. **Set/Map** - When to use, differences
5. **Error** - Error types, error handling

**Study these thoroughly!**
