# Parser

The **Parser** is the first component in the JavaScript engine's code processing pipeline.

## What is a Parser?

- The parser reads JavaScript source code and converts it into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
- It analyzes the syntax and structure of the code to understand what the code means.
- The AST is a tree-like representation that makes it easier for the interpreter to process the code.

## Process

1. **Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)**:

   - Breaks down the source code into tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.)
   - Example: `let x = 5;` → tokens: `let`, `x`, `=`, `5`, `;`

2. **Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**:
   - Takes the tokens and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
   - Validates the syntax according to JavaScript grammar rules
   - Reports syntax errors if the code is invalid

## Output: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- The AST is a tree-like structure that represents the code's structure
- Each node in the tree represents a construct in the source code
- The AST makes it easier for the interpreter to understand and process the code

## Role in JavaScript Engine

```
JavaScript Source Code
    ↓
Parser
    ↓
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    ↓
Interpreter / Compiler
```

- The parser is the **first step** in code execution
- Without a valid AST, the code cannot be executed
- Syntax errors are caught at this stage

## Example

**Source Code:**

```javascript
let x = 5;
```

**AST Representation (simplified):**

```
VariableDeclaration
  ├─ kind: "let"
  ├─ declarations:
  │   └─ VariableDeclarator
  │       ├─ id: "x"
  │       └─ init: 5
```

## Key Points

- ✅ First step in code processing
- ✅ Converts code → AST
- ✅ Catches syntax errors early
- ✅ AST is easier for interpreter/compiler to process
