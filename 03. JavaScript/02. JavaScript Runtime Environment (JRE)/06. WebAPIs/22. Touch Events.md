# Touch Events

Touch events are triggered by touch-based actions, such as tapping or swiping on touchscreen devices.

## Common Touch Events

- `touchstart`
- `touchmove`
- `touchend`
- `touchcancel`

## Properties (Common to All Touch Events)

- **target**: The element that triggered the event.
- **touches**: A list of all current touch points on the screen.
- **changedTouches**: A list of touch points that have changed (e.g., a finger is lifted or moved).
- **targetTouches**: A list of touch points that are currently on the target element.
- **clientX, clientY**: The coordinates of the touch point relative to the viewport.
- **screenX, screenY**: The coordinates of the touch point relative to the screen.
- **pageX, pageY**: The coordinates of the touch point relative to the document.
- **radiusX, radiusY**: The radius of the touch point (for certain devices that report this information).
- **rotationAngle**: The angle of rotation of the touch (for certain devices with rotation support).
- **force**: The force of the touch (e.g., for pressure-sensitive touchscreens).

## Methods (Common to All Touch Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default action associated with the touch event (e.g., preventing scrolling or zooming).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.

## Touch Event-Specific Methods

- **touches.length**: The number of active touches on the screen.
