# Storage APIs

Understanding browser storage APIs: localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, and IndexedDB.

---

## Overview

Browsers provide several storage mechanisms for storing data on the client side:

1. **localStorage** - Persistent storage across sessions
2. **sessionStorage** - Storage for the current tab session
3. **Cookies** - Small data sent with HTTP requests
4. **IndexedDB** - Large structured data storage
5. **Cache API** - For caching network resources (Service Workers)

## Quick Comparison

| Storage Type       | Size Limit | Persistence   | Scope      | Server Accessible | Use Case                   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| **localStorage**   | ~5-10MB    | Until cleared | Per origin | ❌ No             | User preferences, settings |
| **sessionStorage** | ~5-10MB    | Tab session   | Per tab    | ❌ No             | Temporary form data        |
| **Cookies**        | ~4KB       | Until expiry  | Per domain | ✅ Yes            | Authentication, tracking   |
| **IndexedDB**      | ~50% disk  | Until cleared | Per origin | ❌ No             | Large structured data      |
| **Cache API**      | Varies     | Until cleared | Per origin | ❌ No             | Offline resources          |

## Key Takeaways

1. **localStorage** - Use for persistent user preferences
2. **sessionStorage** - Use for temporary data (cleared when tab closes)
3. **Cookies** - Use for server-readable data (authentication, tracking)
4. **IndexedDB** - Use for large structured data
5. **All storage is per-origin** - Isolated by domain and protocol
