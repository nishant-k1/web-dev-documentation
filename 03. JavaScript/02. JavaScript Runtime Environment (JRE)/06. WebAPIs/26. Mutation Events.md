# Mutation Events

Mutation events are triggered when changes are made to the DOM (Document Object Model), such as adding, removing, or modifying elements.

## Common Mutation Events

- `DOMSubtreeModified`
- `DOMNodeInserted`
- `DOMNodeRemoved`
- `DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument`
- `DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument`
- `DOMAttrModified` (deprecated)
- `DOMCharacterDataModified` (deprecated)

## Properties (Common to All Mutation Events)

- **target**: The node that was modified.
- **addedNodes**: A `NodeList` of nodes that were added (if any) during the mutation.
- **removedNodes**: A `NodeList` of nodes that were removed (if any) during the mutation.
- **type**: The type of mutation event (e.g., `DOMNodeInserted`, `DOMAttrModified`).
- **attributeName**: The name of the modified attribute (only for `DOMAttrModified`).
- **attributeNamespace**: The namespace of the modified attribute (only for `DOMAttrModified`).
- **oldValue**: The previous value of the node or attribute before the modification (for certain mutation events like `DOMAttrModified`).

## Methods (Common to All Mutation Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default action associated with the event (if applicable).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.

## Mutation Event-Specific Methods

- **attachEvent()**: In Internet Explorer, attaches an event listener to an element. This is commonly used for older mutation event implementations.
