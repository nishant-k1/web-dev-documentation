# Media Events

Media events are triggered by actions involving media elements such as `<audio>`, `<video>`, or other media sources.

## Common Media Events

- `play`
- `pause`
- `ended`
- `volumechange`
- `timeupdate`
- `seeking`
- `seeked`
- `loadeddata`
- `loadedmetadata`
- `canplay`
- `canplaythrough`
- `stalled`
- `error`

## Properties (Common to All Media Events)

- **target**: The media element (e.g., `<audio>`, `<video>`) that triggered the event.
- **currentTime**: The current playback position of the media in seconds.
- **duration**: The total duration of the media in seconds.
- **paused**: A boolean indicating whether the media is paused.
- **volume**: The current volume level of the media (range 0.0 to 1.0).
- **muted**: A boolean indicating whether the media is muted.
- **readyState**: The current readiness of the media. Possible values:
  - `0`: HAVE_NOTHING
  - `1`: HAVE_METADATA
  - `2`: HAVE_CURRENT_DATA
  - `3`: HAVE_FUTURE_DATA
  - `4`: HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA`
- **buffered**: A `TimeRanges` object representing the portion of the media that has been buffered.

## Methods (Common to All Media Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default action associated with the event (e.g., preventing auto-play or stopping media from buffering).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.

## Media Event-Specific Methods

- **play()**: Starts playback of the media (if not already playing).
- **pause()**: Pauses the playback of the media.
- **load()**: Loads the media (for resetting the media element or reloading its source).
- **seekTo(time)**: Seeks to a specific time in the media.
