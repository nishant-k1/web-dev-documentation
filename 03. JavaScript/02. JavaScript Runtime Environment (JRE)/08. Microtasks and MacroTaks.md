# Microtasks vs Macrotasks

## What Microtask Queue Handles

- Promise callbacks (.then, .catch, .finally)
- queueMicrotask() - can queue any function
- MutationObserver callbacks
- async/await continuations (which are promise-based)
- process.nextTick() in Node.js (technically a separate microtask-like queue)

## What Macrotask Queue (Task Queue) Handles

- Timer callbacks (setTimeout, setInterval)
- I/O operations
- UI rendering tasks
- Event handlers (click, scroll, etc.)
- Script loading
- requestAnimationFrame (though technically in its own queue)
- Observer callbacks (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
- MessageChannel, postMessage

Key Point:
While many of these are callbacks, the queues can contain:

Any executable code/function - not just callbacks
Browser rendering operations (layout, paint, composite)
Event loop tasks that aren't necessarily "callbacks" in the traditional sense

For example, when you use queueMicrotask(() => console.log('hi')), you're queuing a regular function, not necessarily a "callback" from an async API.
Better way to think about it: These queues hold tasks (units of work to execute), which can be callbacks, functions, or browser operations.
