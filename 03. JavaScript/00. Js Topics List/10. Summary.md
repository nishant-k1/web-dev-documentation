# Summary

"Advanced JavaScript" includes both ECMAScript features and JRE features, not just JRE.

Breakdown:

## 1. Advanced ECMAScript Features (language-level)

- Execution Context, Closures, Prototypes
- Meta-Programming (Proxy, Reflect)
- Generators, Iterators
- Advanced Object manipulation
- Module patterns

## 2. JavaScript Runtime Environment Features (environment-level)

- Web APIs (DOM, Fetch, Storage)
- Event Loop mechanics
- Browser Internals
- Performance optimization techniques

The overview file (1. Js Topics List.md) has been updated to reflect this. The current 4. JavaScript Advanced.md already includes both categories, which is correct.
In practice: "Advanced JavaScript" means going beyond basics to cover both deeper language concepts and how JavaScript interacts with its runtime environment.
