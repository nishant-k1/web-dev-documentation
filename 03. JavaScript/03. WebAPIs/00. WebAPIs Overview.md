# WebAPIs Overview

## What Are WebAPIs?

**WebAPIs (Web Application Programming Interfaces)** are browser-provided APIs that extend JavaScript's capabilities beyond the ECMAScript language specification. They allow JavaScript to interact with the browser environment, the DOM, network, storage, and more.

## ⚠️ Important: WebAPIs Are Provided BY the Browser Runtime (Not Core JRE)

**This folder (`03. WebAPIs/`) contains APIs provided by the browser's runtime environment.**

WebAPIs are **not** part of the ECMAScript language specification. They are **not** core components of the JavaScript Runtime Environment. Instead, they are **APIs provided by the browser** that enable JavaScript to:

- Interact with the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Handle events (mouse, keyboard, touch, etc.)
- Make network requests (fetch, XMLHttpRequest)
- Store data (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB)
- Access browser features (window, navigator, location)
- Perform background tasks (Web Workers)
- And much more...

## Relationship to ECMAScript vs JRE

| Category       | What It Is             | Examples                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ECMAScript** | Language specification | `Promise`, `Array`, `Object`, `String`, `async/await`                   |
| **Core JRE**   | Runtime engine         | Call Stack, Heap, Event Loop, Task Queues, Parser, Interpreter, JIT, GC |
| **WebAPIs**    | Browser-provided APIs  | `fetch`, `setTimeout`, `localStorage`, `DOM`, `addEventListener`        |

**Key Distinction:**

- **Core JRE** = The JavaScript Runtime Engine itself (Call Stack, Heap, Event Loop, Task Queues)
- **WebAPIs** = APIs provided BY the browser runtime environment (not the core runtime)

**Key Point:** JavaScript runs in a **runtime environment** (browser or Node.js) that provides WebAPIs beyond the core language.
