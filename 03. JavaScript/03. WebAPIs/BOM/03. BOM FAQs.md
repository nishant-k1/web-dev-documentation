# FAQs BOM

## BOM vs window

- BOM ≠ window
- But window is the core object of the BOM.
- BOM (Browser Object Model) is the collection of browser-specific objects that allow JavaScript to interact with the browser outside of the web page's content.
- window is the root object that holds all BOM-related properties and methods.
- window is just the entry point to access BOM features.

| Concept      | Is `window`?             | Explanation                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BOM**      | ❌ Not equal to `window` | It's a group of browser-specific objects (and `window` is just one of them). |
| **`window`** | ✅ Part of BOM           | Root/global object that contains the other BOM APIs.                         |

## DOM vs document

- DOM ≠ document
- But document is the main entry point into the DOM.
- DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure representing the HTML (or XML) content of a web page.
- It lets JavaScript read, traverse, and manipulate the page structure dynamically.
- document is a global object provided by the browser to let you interact with the DOM.
- It's your main access point to the DOM.

| Concept        | Is it the same as...? | Explanation                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOM**        | ❌ `document`         | The actual **model/structure** of your HTML in memory.  |
| **`document`** | ✅ Entry to DOM       | JavaScript **object** that gives you access to the DOM. |

Analogy
Think of the DOM as the entire house (HTML structure),
and document as the door you use to enter and modify the house.

## Why document not part of the BOM although it is property of widow object and we can access it via window.document?

Let's resolve this confusion once and for all by distinguishing between:

✅ Where something is accessible
❌ Versus what system it logically belongs to

💡 Quick Analogy
You can access Netflix on your smart TV.
But that doesn't mean Netflix is part of the TV.

It's just available through the TV interface.
Similarly:

You can access document via window.document,
but document is not part of BOM — it's part of the DOM.

**What is window?**
window is the global object in the browser.

It contains everything that's globally accessible:

DOM APIs (document, HTMLElement)

BOM APIs (navigator, location, alert)

Web APIs (fetch, WebSocket)

Timers (setTimeout)

Custom globals (myGlobalVariable = 10)

`Being a property of window does not define the API group it belongs to.`

**Here's how the WebAPIs are grouped:**

| API Group       | Purpose                             | Examples                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOM**         | Work with the HTML document (page)  | `document`, `Element`, `HTMLElement`, `querySelector`, `innerText`     |
| **BOM**         | Work with browser features          | `window`, `navigator`, `location`, `screen`, `alert()`, `setTimeout()` |
| **Modern APIs** | Network & browser-provided features | `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `localStorage`, `Notification`                   |

window
├── document ← DOM (not BOM)
│ └── body
│ └── div, p, etc.
├── navigator ← BOM
├── location ← BOM
├── setTimeout ← BOM
├── fetch ← Web API (Networking)
├── HTMLElement ← DOM

## webAPIs and BOM is different? setTimeout is BOM not a webAPI while fetch is webAPI?

Web APIs = Big umbrella term
Web APIs are all browser-provided APIs available to JavaScript that are not part of the core JS language (like Array, Promise, etc.).

They include:
DOM API – Working with HTML (document, Element, etc.)
BOM API – Interacting with the browser (location, alert, screen, etc.)
Modern APIs – Like fetch, WebSocket, Notification, etc.

BOM = A smaller part of Web APIs
BOM is one of the oldest subsets of the Web API. It deals only with the browser window and environment.
Classic BOM examples:

window

- `alert(), confirm(), prompt()`
- `setTimeout(), setInterval()`
- `location, navigator, screen, history`

## So what is setTimeout?

It's historically considered BOM (because it came early, tied to browser window behavior).
But technically, it's also part of Web APIs, because it's provided by the browser, not the JS engine (like V8).

## What about fetch?

fetch() is a modern Web API, introduced later.
It is not part of the BOM, because it's not tied to the browser window or UI — it's for networking.
You won't find it on old BOM API lists.

| Feature       | Part of BOM? | Part of Web API? | Explanation                                |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `setTimeout`  | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes           | Provided by the browser (historically BOM) |
| `fetch`       | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes           | Modern Web API (not part of BOM)           |
| `alert`       | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes           | BOM + available globally in browsers       |
| `document`    | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes           | DOM API (subset of Web APIs)               |
| `console.log` | ✅ Yes-ish   | ✅ Yes           | Browser-provided utility, not formal spec  |
| `HTMLElement` | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes           | DOM API                                    |

| API Name       | Part of BOM | Part of Web API | Category             |

| `window`       | ✅          | ✅              | BOM                  |
| `alert()`      | ✅          | ✅              | BOM                  |
| `setTimeout()` | ✅          | ✅              | BOM                  |
| `document`     | ❌          | ✅              | DOM (Web API)        |
| `fetch()`      | ❌          | ✅              | Networking (Web API) |
| `localStorage` | ❌          | ✅              | Storage (Web API)    |
| `console.log`  | ✅(loosely) | ✅              | DevTools Utility     |

## BOM vs DOM: Where Does `HTMLElement` Belong?

`HTMLElement` is **not** part of the BOM. It is part of the **DOM**.

---

## 📁 BOM (Browser Object Model)

The BOM provides tools to interact with the **browser environment**, not the page content.

- Includes objects like:
  - `window`
  - `navigator`
  - `location`
  - `history`
  - `screen`
  - `alert()`, `confirm()`, `prompt()`
  - `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, etc.
- Purpose: Interact with browser settings, tabs, URLs, and user environment.

---

## 🧩 DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM represents the **structure of the HTML document** — the elements you see and interact with.

- Includes:
  - `document`
  - `Element`, `Node`, `HTMLElement`
  - `HTMLDivElement`, `HTMLImageElement`, etc.
  - Properties/methods like `.innerHTML`, `.appendChild()`, `.style`, etc.
- Purpose: Access and manipulate the page's content and structure.

---

## ✅ So What is `HTMLElement`?

- `HTMLElement` is a **class (constructor)** that all HTML elements inherit from.
- It is available globally:
  ```js
  console.log(window.HTMLElement === HTMLElement); // true
  ```
- Even though it's a property of `window`, it's **not part of BOM** — it's part of the **DOM API**.

| `location`       | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        | Provides current URL info        |
| `alert()`        | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        | Displays a browser dialog        |
| `.innerHTML`     | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       | Property of `HTMLElement`        |
| `HTMLDivElement` | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       | Inherits from `HTMLElement`      |

## 🧠 How to Remember

- **BOM = Browser**: Things _outside_ your page (tabs, screen, URL, etc.)
- **DOM = Document**: Things _inside_ your HTML (elements, content, tags)
