Yeah, absolutely. So there are a few other things that follow a similar pattern. For instance, things like the `PerformanceObserver`, which you can use to watch for performance-related entries, also works this way. You create it as a separate object rather than it being a direct property on the document or an element. Same goes for something like the `ResizeObserver` we talked about or even a `MediaQueryList` if you're listening for changes in media queries with JavaScript. So yeah, there are a handful of these observer-like or watcher-like APIs that are all part of the DOM ecosystem, but you create them with constructors and then hook them into the DOM rather than just accessing them directly as properties.
