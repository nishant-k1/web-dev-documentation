# Focus Events

Focus events are triggered when an element gains or loses focus, typically used with form elements like input fields, textareas, and select elements.

## Common Focus Events

- `focus`
- `blur`
- `focusin` (bubbles)
- `focusout` (bubbles)

## Properties (Common to All Focus Events)

- **target**: The element that triggered the event.
- **relatedTarget**: The element that the focus is moving to or from (only for `focusout` and `blur` events).

## Methods (Common to All Focus Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default action associated with the event (e.g., preventing focus change in certain cases).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.

## Focus Event-Specific Methods

- **focus()**: Programmatically focuses an element (e.g., calling this on an input element will set focus to it).
- **blur()**: Programmatically removes focus from an element (e.g., calling this on an input element will remove focus from it).
