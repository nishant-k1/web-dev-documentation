Yeah, exactly! So MediaQueryList is another one of those. It's like when you want to listen for changes in a CSS media query in JavaScript. You create a MediaQueryList object, and then you can add a listener to it. So it's the same kind of idea: it's not a direct property on the document or an element, but it's part of the DOM API that you create and then use to react to changes. So yeah, it fits right into that same category of these observer-like tools in the DOM world.
