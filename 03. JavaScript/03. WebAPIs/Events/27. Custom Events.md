# Custom Events

Custom events are user-defined events that allow developers to trigger and listen to custom behavior within an application. These events are typically used when built-in events don't meet the needs of the application.

## Common Custom Events

- `CustomEvent` (constructor)
- Any event name that you define (e.g., `myCustomEvent`)

## Properties (Common to All Custom Events)

- **target**: The element that triggered the event.
- **detail**: A property that holds custom data associated with the event. This can be any object or value that you want to pass along with the event.
- **bubbles**: A boolean indicating whether the event bubbles up through the DOM.
- **cancelable**: A boolean indicating whether the event can be canceled using `preventDefault()`.
- **type**: The name of the event (e.g., `myCustomEvent`).

## Methods (Common to All Custom Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default behavior associated with the event (if applicable).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.

## Creating and Dispatching Custom Events

- **new CustomEvent(type, options)**: The constructor for creating a new custom event.

  - **type**: The name of the event (e.g., `myCustomEvent`).
  - **options**: An optional object containing additional properties:
    - `detail`: Custom data associated with the event.
    - `bubbles`: Boolean indicating whether the event should bubble.
    - `cancelable`: Boolean indicating whether the event is cancelable.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  const event = new CustomEvent("myCustomEvent", {
    detail: { someData: "data" },
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
  });
  element.dispatchEvent(event);
  ```
