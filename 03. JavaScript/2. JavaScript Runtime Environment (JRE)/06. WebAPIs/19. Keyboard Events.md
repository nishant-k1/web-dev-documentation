# Keyboard Events

Keyboard events are triggered by actions involving the keyboard, such as pressing or releasing keys.

## Common Keyboard Events

- `keydown`
- `keypress` (deprecated, use `keydown` or `keyup` instead)
- `keyup`

## Properties (Common to All Keyboard Events)

- **target**: The element that triggered the event.
- **key**: The value of the key pressed (e.g., `'Enter'`, `'a'`, `'Shift'`).
- **code**: The physical key on the keyboard (e.g., `'KeyA'`, `'Space'`).
- **altKey**: A boolean indicating whether the `Alt` key was pressed during the event.
- **ctrlKey**: A boolean indicating whether the `Ctrl` key was pressed during the event.
- **shiftKey**: A boolean indicating whether the `Shift` key was pressed during the event.
- **metaKey**: A boolean indicating whether the `Meta` key (e.g., `Cmd` on macOS) was pressed during the event.
- **location**: The location of the key on the keyboard (e.g., 0 for standard keys, 1 for left-side keys, 2 for right-side keys).
- **repeat**: A boolean indicating whether the key is being held down and is repeating (for events like `keydown`).

## Methods (Common to All Keyboard Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default action associated with the key event (e.g., preventing the form submission on pressing `Enter`).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from bubbling up through the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from bubbling and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.
