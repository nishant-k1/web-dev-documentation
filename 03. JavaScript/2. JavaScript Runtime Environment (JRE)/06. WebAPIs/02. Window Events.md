# Window Events

Window events are triggered by actions that affect the browser window or viewport.

## Common Window Events

- `resize`
- `scroll`
- `load`
- `beforeunload`
- `unload`

## Properties (Common to All Window Events)

- **target**: The window or document object.
- **clientX, clientY**: Coordinates related to the viewport for events like `resize` or `scroll`.
- **eventType**: The type of event that is being triggered (e.g., `resize`, `scroll`, etc.).
- **bubbles**: Indicates whether the event bubbles up through the DOM.
- **cancelable**: Indicates whether the event can be canceled using `preventDefault()`.

## Methods (Common to All Window Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default behavior (e.g., preventing a page reload).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up to other listeners.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and also prevents other listeners on the same event from being called.
