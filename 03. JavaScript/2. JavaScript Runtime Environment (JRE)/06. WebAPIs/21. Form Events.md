# Form Events

Form events are triggered by actions involving forms, such as submitting a form or changing input values.

## Common Form Events

- `submit`
- `reset`
- `input`
- `change`
- `focus`
- `blur`
- `select`
- `invalid`

## Properties (Common to All Form Events)

- **target**: The form element (or input element) that triggered the event.
- **value**: The current value of the input field (for events like `input`, `change`, etc.).
- **name**: The name of the form element that triggered the event.
- **checked**: A boolean indicating whether a checkbox or radio button is checked (for `input` events).
- **selectedIndex**: The index of the selected option in a `<select>` element (for `change` events on select inputs).
- **files**: A list of selected files (for file input elements during events like `change`).
- **disabled**: A boolean indicating whether the form element is disabled.

## Methods (Common to All Form Events)

- **preventDefault()**: Prevents the default form action (e.g., preventing form submission on `submit`).
- **stopPropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM.
- **stopImmediatePropagation()**: Prevents the event from propagating and stops other listeners on the same event from being triggered.

## Specific Form Event Methods

- **setCustomValidity()**: Sets a custom error message for form validation.
