# State Management at Scale

1. Local State: Use useState and useReducer for component-level state.

2. Global State:
   Redux Toolkit: For predictable, scalable state management.
   Context API: For lightweight global state needs.
   React Query: For server-state caching and synchronization.

3. Normalization: Normalize data to avoid deeply nested state objects, using libraries like normalizr.
