INTERFACES : custom type or specific structure to objects / functions 

interface and types are almost same. interface could be preferred over type in case of objects.

Difference between interface and type 
    type can be used with primitives and unions but Interface can't be used with primitive and unions.
    interface should be preferred over types for describing objects.
