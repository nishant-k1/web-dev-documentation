# Click event with user event

- user event library comes with the react testing library

## Why we should use user event library

- user event library is specifically made for testing user events
- testing events like onChange event, click event directly using the RTL library would be little more complicated and sometimes not possible to test at all
- for example fireEvent comes with the RTL but it is not capable enough to test all the events

## update user event library

## write click event with state

## test click event with user event
