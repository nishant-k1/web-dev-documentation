# RTL Query: getAllByrole

- When we're using getByRole, mostly we are testing a single element or when the multiple element has something diffrent like labels or attributes
- When multiple elements are quite same including the labels & attributes then getAllByRole is more helpful

## Handle multiple elements

## Multiple buttons with the same role

## Multiple select options box with same role
