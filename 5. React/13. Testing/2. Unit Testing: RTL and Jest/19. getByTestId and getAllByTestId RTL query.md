5# RTL query: getByTestId, getAllByTestId

## use of getByTestId

- we can attach `test-id` attribute to any elements
- It is necessary in automaton testing

## use of getAllByTestId

## Test single elements with test id

## Test multiple elements with test id

## overriding data-testid

### Why we need to override test id

- if we want to use any other test id attribute in place of `data-testId`
- During automation testing testers assign their own attribute we can use that as well in place of the `data-testId`

### How to override test id (`data-testId`) attribute

- RTL provides a property called configure using which we can override the data-testId

### Test elements after override test id
