# Functional component method testing

## Possible cases for the method testing

## Define the button, click event and method

## Test method with event

## Test method without event

1. We can't test functional component method without event
2. We can convert functional component into a class component to test its method if testing is very necessary
3. It's not necessary to test methods in functional components.
4. We can write thaose functions (without evnet ) in a separate file and then we can test them by creating test file for that file
