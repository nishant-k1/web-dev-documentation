# test api call using MSW

## MSW (Mock Service Worker):

- MSW is a client-side library used for mocking HTTP requests in browser-based JavaScript applications, such as Single Page Applications (SPAs) or web apps built with frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular.

- It allows you to intercept outgoing HTTP requests made by your application and respond to them with mock data or predefined responses. This is useful for testing your application's behavior under various conditions, such as network failures or different server responses.

- MSW works within the browser environment and does not require a server to function. It runs entirely in the client's browser and does not involve server-side processing
