Step1:  inside the index.js file ----
            
    Step1: import { Provider } from 'react-redux' in you index.js file 

    Step2: import { store } from '~/state/store' in you index.js file 

    Step3: make the App component children of the Provider component and pass store as props to the Provider component. 
        <Provider store = {store}>
            <App />
        </Provider>

Step3:  create a folder called redux or state or features under the src folder of the react app. Now inside state folder ---

    Step1:  create a store.js file 

    Step2:  create a componentSlice.js file for the component whose state you want to make globally available. eg: headerSlice.js for the Header component 

Step4:  inside the store.js file ----
    Step1:  import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux' 

    Step2:  import ReduxThunk from 'redux-thunk'

    Step3:  import componentSlice.js from the './componentSlice.js' to get to the access to the reducer of the component whose state you want to make globally available.

    Step4:  create a reducers object and pass it as an argument to the combineReducers()
                Eg: const reducers = {reducer1: reducer1, reducer2: reducer2, ...}
                    combineReducers(reducers)

    Step5:  create a rootReducer variable and assign it combineReducers(reducers)
                Eg: const rootReducer = combineReducers(reducers)

    Step6:  create a middlewares variable and assign it composeEnhancers (applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk))
                Eg: const middlewares = composeEnhancers (applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk))

    Step7:  create a store variable and assign createStore (rootReducer, middlewares)
                Eg: const store = createStore (rootReducer, middlewares)

    Step8:  export the store variable
                Eg: export default store 

Step5: inside the componentSlice.js file create a reducer function that takes previous state and action object as argument and returns a new state based on the type condition.

    Eg: headerReducer = (state = 0, {type, payload}) => {
        switch(type){
            case 'TYPE_A':
                return newState,
            case 'TYPE_B':
                return newState,
            default:
                return state
        }
    }

Step6: inside the components where we want to use the state of that component---

    Step1: import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'

        useSelector
            1. useSelector is a redux hook whose return value is the current state (of the component whose state you want to make available globally). 
            2. It takes in a function as an argument .
            3. This argument function has a single parameter which receives the value of the rootReducer object from the store.
            4. Now, you have the access to the rootReducer object, you can get the access to all the reducers(which is nothing but the newState returned by the respective reducer function)
            
            Eg: const state = useSelector(state => state)

        useDispatch 
            1. useDispatch is redux-hook whose return value is a function
            2. this returned function on call takes in action object as its argument. 
            3. action object has only two properties, type and payload 

                const action = {type: 'SOME_TYPE', payload: 'SOME_PAYLOAD'}
                Eg: const dispatch = useDispatch()
                    dispatch({type: 'SOME_TYPE', payload: 'SOME_PAYLOAD'})

            3. this action passed as an argument, is received in the 2nd parameter of the reducer function of component (whose state you want to make available globally). 
            4. Now you can manipulate the payload and create and return a new state for the component (whose state you want to make available globally).
