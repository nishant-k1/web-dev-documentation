## React Interview Preparation Roadmap

**1. Strengthen React Fundamentals**

- **Core Concepts:**
  - Components (Functional and Class)
  - JSX
  - Props and State
  - Lifecycle Methods (Class Components) vs. Hooks (Functional Components)
  - Virtual DOM and Reconciliation
  - Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext
  - Advanced hooks like useMemo, useCallback, useReducer, useRef
  - Context API: How to use createContext and useContext to manage global state.
  - Event Handling: Handling events and passing data using event handlers.

**2. Advanced React Topics**

- **React Router:** Nested routes, dynamic routing, route guards.
- **State Management:** When to use useState, Context API, Redux, or Redux Toolkit.
  - Understanding selectors, middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk).
- **Performance Optimization:** Code-splitting, lazy loading (React.lazy), memoization (React.memo).
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Basics of SSR and its benefits (Next.js is key here).
- **Static Site Generation (SSG) vs. SSR vs. Client-Side Rendering (CSR).**
- **Testing:** Writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Mocking components and APIs.

**3. JavaScript Concepts for React**

- **ES6+ Features:** let, const, destructuring, spread/rest operators.
- **Arrow functions, template literals, modules (import/export).**
- **Advanced JS:** Closures, promises, async/await, this keyword, event loop.
- **TypeScript:** Basic types, interfaces, type aliases, generics, type assertions.
  - Using TypeScript with React components and props.

**4. System Design and Architecture**

- **Component Design:** Splitting components for reusability and scalability.
- **State Management:** Choosing the right tool based on use cases.
- **Error Boundaries:** Handling errors gracefully in React apps.

**5. Hands-On Projects**

- Build small projects to showcase your React skills, like:
  - A TODO app with CRUD operations and local storage.
  - An e-commerce site with product filtering, cart management, and API integration.
  - A weather dashboard or cryptocurrency tracker using public APIs.

**6. Mock Interviews**

- Practice common React interview questions:
  - What are React's key features?
  - What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
  - Explain the purpose of keys in React.
  - What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
  - What problems does React solve?
- Solve practical coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSandbox.

**7. Study Data Structures and Algorithms**

- Practice problems on arrays, strings, objects, recursion, and trees.
- Use React-focused coding scenarios:
  - Render a table with search and filter functionality.
  - Implement infinite scrolling or a virtualized list.

**8. Behavioral and Situational Questions**

- Prepare answers for:
  - Challenges you faced while working with React.
  - Your approach to debugging and optimizing a React app.
  - How do you stay updated with the latest React trends?

**9. Resources**

- **Official Documentation:** React Docs
- **Courses:**
  - "React – The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzmüller (Udemy)
  - "Full Stack Open" (Free)
- **YouTube Channels:** Web Dev Simplified, The Net Ninja, Akshay Saini.
- **Practice Platforms:** CodeSandbox, Frontend Mentor.

**10. Schedule Your Preparation**

With your experience, dedicate 4–6 weeks:

- **Week 1–2:** Focus on React fundamentals and JavaScript.
- **Week 3–4:** Dive into advanced topics, state management, and testing.
- **Week 5–6:** Work on projects, mock interviews, and optimize weak areas.
