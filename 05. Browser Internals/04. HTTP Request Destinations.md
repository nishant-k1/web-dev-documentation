# HTTP Request Destinations

Understanding where automatic HTML requests go (localhost, production, CDN, backend).

---

## Where Do Automatic Requests Go?

HTML automatic requests can go to **any server**, depending on the URL you provide.

---

## Case 1: Localhost (Development)

If your React app runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

HTML like this:

```html
<img src="/logo.png" />
<script src="/main.js"></script>
```

**Requests go to:**

- `http://localhost:5173/logo.png`
- `http://localhost:5173/main.js`

**Why?** Because the base URL is `localhost:5173`.

---

## Case 2: Production Server (Your Domain)

If your site is live at:

```
https://mywebsite.com/
```

Same HTML:

```html
<img src="/hero.jpg" />
<script src="/main.js"></script>
```

**Requests go to:**

- `https://mywebsite.com/hero.jpg`
- `https://mywebsite.com/main.js`

**NOT localhost** → They go to your domain.

---

## Case 3: CDN (Content Delivery Network)

If you give a CDN link:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.example.com/banner.png" />
```

**Request goes to:**

- `https://cdn.example.com/banner.png`

**NOT localhost** → External CDN server.

---

## Case 4: External Domains

```html
<img src="https://randomsite.com/photo.png" />
```

**Request goes to:**

- `https://randomsite.com/photo.png`

---

## Case 5: Relative URLs

If you're on:

```
https://nishant.dev/blog/
```

And you write:

```html
<img src="photo.jpg" />
```

**Browser requests:**

- `https://nishant.dev/blog/photo.jpg`

It uses the current URL path as the base.

## Summary Table

| Resource URL                   | Request Goes To                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/path/file`                   | Same server as the website (localhost in dev, domain in prod) |
| `./file`                       | Same folder as current page                                   |
| `file.jpg`                     | Same folder as current page                                   |
| `https://example.com/file`     | External server                                               |
| `https://cdn.company.com/file` | CDN server                                                    |

## Can Automatic Requests Go to Backend Server?

**YES** — if your HTML points to your backend's URL.

**Example:**

```html
<img src="https://api.mybackend.com/uploads/profile.png" />
```

**Browser sends:**

```
GET https://api.mybackend.com/uploads/profile.png
```

**Backend receives it and responds with the image.**

### BUT IMPORTANT:

- ✅ Automatic requests can hit your backend for **files** (images, CSS, JS)
- ❌ Automatic requests **cannot** call your backend's **API endpoints** for data

**Why?**

- Automatic requests are always **GET requests**
- They expect **files** (CSS, JS, image...)
- If your backend returns JSON → Browser will treat it as a file and probably fail

**To call API endpoints:**

- Use `fetch()` or `axios` (JavaScript)

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Browser follows URLs** — Requests go wherever the URL points
- **Relative paths** — Resolved based on current page URL
- **Absolute URLs** — Go to that specific domain
- **Backend can serve files** — But not API endpoints via HTML tags
