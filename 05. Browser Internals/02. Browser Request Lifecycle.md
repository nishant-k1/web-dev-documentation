# Browser Request Lifecycle

Understanding how browsers initiate and handle HTTP requests.

---

## Core Concept

**HTTP is a protocol for communication between a client and a server.**

- The **browser** is always the **HTTP client**
- The **server** can be:
  - Your backend API
  - Your CDN (for static files)
  - Your development server (`localhost:5173`)
  - Any web server

## How Browsers Load Webpages

When you open `https://example.com`, the browser performs a series of HTTP requests:

### 1. HTML Request

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Server responds with HTML

### 2. Resource Requests (Automatic)

As the browser parses HTML, it encounters:

- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css">` → GET `/styles.css`
- `<script src="/main.js"></script>` → GET `/main.js`
- `<img src="/logo.png">` → GET `/logo.png`

Each resource triggers its own HTTP request automatically.

## Browser vs JavaScript Requests

| Purpose           | Example                                         | Who Initiates         | Why                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Resource Loading  | Browser fetching `main.js`, `style.css`, images | Browser automatically | To render the webpage |
| API Communication | `fetch('/api/users')`                           | Your JS code          | To get dynamic data   |

**Both use HTTP**, but for different purposes:

- **Static assets** → Browser needs them to display the page
- **APIs** → Your JS logic needs them to fetch data dynamically

## Key Insight

HTTP is like a **highway** between your computer (browser) and the internet (servers). Whether you're sending a REST API call or downloading a `.png` file — you're just driving a different _type of vehicle_ on the _same road_.
